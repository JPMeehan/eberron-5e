    value: >-
      <p>Ashurak opens your heart and mind to the glory of the plague. You
      automatically fail all saving throws against disease, but you are immune
      to all effects of diseases except for any effect that would infect another
      creature. In addition, you can also cast the contagion spell up to three
      times, after which this dark gift vanishes.</p>
