      <p>Sul Khatesh reveals to you a passage of lore from her forbidden tomes.
      You have advantage on ability checks to recall or decipher lore about
      spells, rituals, magical effects, and magical creatures. In addition, you
      can use an action to recite cursed words from the passages Sul Khatesh has
      revealed. When you do, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each creature you
      can see within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>
