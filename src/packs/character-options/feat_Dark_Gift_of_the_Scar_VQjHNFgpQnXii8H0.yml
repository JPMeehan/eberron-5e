    value: >-
      <p>Sakinnirot empowers you with its slow and patient hate. Each creature
      that deals damage to you becomes your resented adversary for as long as
      you have this dark gift. You have advantage on all attack rolls and
      opposed ability checks against your resented adversaries. Additionally,
      when you make an attack roll or opposed ability check against one of your
      resented adversaries, you can choose to change the die result to a natural
      20, after which this dark gift vanishes.</p>
