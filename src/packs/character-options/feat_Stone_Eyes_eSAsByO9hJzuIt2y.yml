      <p>Your Petrifying Gaze has come into its own. If a creature that has the
      Restrained or Paralyzed condition as a result of one of your spells or
      your Medusaâ€™s Gift trait fails a saving throw to end the effect by 5 or
      more, you can choose to turn that creature to stone. Any magical effects
      causing the creature to have the Restrained or Paralyzed condition end,
      and the creature has the Petrified condition for 1 minute. You must
      concentrate to maintain the effect. If you lose your Concentration, the
      Petrified condition ends.</p><p>If you maintain your Concentration on the
      effect for the entire possible duration, the target is Petrified until the
      condition is ended by Greater Restoration or similar magic.</p>
