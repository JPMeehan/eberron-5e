    value: >-
      <p>You awaken your mind to see beyond space and time, granting you the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p></li><li><p>Your psionic senses
      grant you a vague impression of a space you can’t see. By touching a solid
      barrier that’s no more than 1 foot thick and concentrating for 1 minute
      (as if concentrating on a spell), you learn whether at least one living
      creature is within 30 feet of you on the other side of the barrier, and
      you learn the approximate size and rough shape of the space, to a maximum
      of 30 feet on each side. If any side is greater than 30 feet, you don’t
      learn that side’s measurement, and instead simply learn if it is an
      enclosed space (such as a room or cavern) or an open space (such as a
      courtyard or alley). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again
      until you finish a short or long rest.</p></li><li><p>You learn the augury
      spell, which you can cast without a spell slot or components. Once you
      cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long
      rest. You can also cast this spell as a ritual, or by using spell slots
      you have of the appropriate level. This spell’s spellcasting ability is
      the ability increased by this feat.</p></li></ul>
