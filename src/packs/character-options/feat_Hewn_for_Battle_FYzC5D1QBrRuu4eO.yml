      <p>You have reshaped your stone body to be a more effective and
      devastating weapon of war. You gain the following
      benefits.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase your
      Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of
      20.</p><p><strong>Thickened Hide.</strong> When you finish a Short or Long
      Rest, you can choose the thickness of your natural armor. While you arenâ€™t
      wearing armor, your base Armor Class becomes your choice of either 14 plus
      your Dexterity modifier, or 18. You can use a Shield and still gain this
      benefit.</p><p><strong>Spellcarving.</strong> Your hide can be enchanted
      or infused as if it were nonmagical armor.</p><p><strong>Claws.</strong>
      You have shaped your hands into fearsome claws. Your claws are natural
      weapons, which you can use to make Unarmed Strikes. If you hit with them,
      you deal Slashing damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier in place
      of the normal Bludgeoning damage of your Unarmed Strike.</p>
