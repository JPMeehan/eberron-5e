    value: >-
      <p>Masvirik’s gifts seed primordial fears of all things that slither in
      the dark. As an action, you can choose to emit an aura that impresses
      these fears on other creatures for 1 minute. Each creature of your choice,
      other than a reptilian or draconic creature, that starts its turn within
      30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
      of reptilian and draconic creatures. A frightened target can repeat the
      saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
      on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends
      for it, the target is immune to your aura for the next 24 hours. Once you
      use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>
