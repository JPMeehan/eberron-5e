      <p>Youâ€™ve learned the forbidden secrets of the Shadow, allowing you to
      alter how your spells function:</p><ul><li><p>You learn two Metamagic
      options of your choice from the Forbidden Metamagic list. You can use only
      one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless the option says
      otherwise. Whenever you reach a level that grants the Ability Score
      Improvement feature, you can replace one of these Metamagic options with
      another one from the Forbidden Metamagic list.</p></li><li><p>You gain 2
      sorcery points to spend on Metamagic (these points are added to any
      sorcery points you have from another source but can be used only on
      Metamagic). You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long
      rest.</p></li></ul>
