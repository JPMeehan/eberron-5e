      "value": "<p>You’ve learned to wield your psionic power to shape intangible ideas into physical objects, granting you the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p></li><li><p>As an action, you conjure a nonmagical weapon, tool, or similar object in your hand. The item must be worth no more than 25 gp, weigh no more than 10 pounds, be no more than 5 feet along its largest dimension, and be of a form and material you have seen and are familiar with. The item disappears after 10 minutes or when you conjure another item with this ability. If a creature uses its action to examine the object, the creature can recognize it’s a conjured simulacrum with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC; this save’s spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.</p></li><li><p>You learn the <em>summon beast</em><sup>TCE</sup> spell, which you can cast without a spell slot or components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Whenever you cast this spell, the summoned spirit is a Construct instead of a Beast. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. This spell’s spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.</p></li></ul>",
