      <p>Your ability to shapechange is more than skin deep. Increase your
      Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20. In addition, when you use
      your Shapechanging trait, you can choose one of the following benefits,
      which lasts until you use your Shapechanging trait again. Some of these
      benefits require specific physical features, such as gills or claws, that
      can be seen by observers.</p><p><strong>Aquatic Adaptation.</strong> You
      adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing
      webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a
      swimming speed equal to your walking
      speed.</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You adapt your eyes and gain
      darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p><p><strong>Natural
      Weapons.</strong> You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different
      natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning,
      piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you
      chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p>
