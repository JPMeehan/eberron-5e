    value: >-
      <p>You have studied the techniques perfected by the Order of the Onyx
      Skull. You learn the bonecraft armor* and find steed spells. You can cast
      both of these spells without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest
      before you can cast either of these spells in this way again. You can also
      cast these spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate
      level.</p><p>Your spellcasting ability for this feat's spells is
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (chosen when you select this
      feat).</p><p>In addition, whenever you cast find steed, the steedâ€™s
      creature type is Undead, rather than Celestial, Fey, or Fiend. The steed
      is immune to turning while it remains within 15 feet of you, and its hit
      point maximum is calculated using the highest number possible for each Hit
      Die.</p>
