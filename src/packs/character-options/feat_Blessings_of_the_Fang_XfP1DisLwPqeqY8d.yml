    value: >-
      <p>When you touch a creature that has been reduced to 0 hit points or
      killed within the last minute, you can choose to kill it (if it isnâ€™t
      already dead) and remove its soul. A creature whose soul has been removed
      in this way can be restored to life only by a wish spell.</p>
