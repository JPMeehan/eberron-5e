    value: >-
      <p>Tiamat kindles the rage of dragonfire within your heart. Once on your
      turn when you make a weapon attack, you can replace that attack with an
      exhalation of magical energy in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each
      creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your
      Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the
      creature takes 1d10 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your
      choice). On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage
      increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and
      17th level (4d10). You can use this breath weapon a number of times equal
      to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.</p>
