    value: >-
      <p>The Wild Heart connects you to your predatory nature and you embrace a
      more bestial appearance. You grow claws that you can use to make unarmed
      strikes. When you hit with these claws, the strike deals 1d6 + your
      Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage
      normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, you can use an action to gain
      resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks
      that arenâ€™t silvered for 1 hour, after which this dark gift vanishes.</p>
