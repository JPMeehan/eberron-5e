    value: >-
      <p>With Bel Shalor’s gift, your mind opens to the darkness at the edge of
      all mortal minds. When you see a creature cast a spell or use a magical
      effect that would restore hit points to one or more other creatures, you
      can use your reaction to instead cause that effect to deal necrotic damage
      to each target equal to the number of hit points that would have been
      restored. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
