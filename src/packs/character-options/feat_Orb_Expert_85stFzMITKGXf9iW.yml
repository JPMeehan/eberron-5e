      <p>Your skill with magical Orbs helps you evade enemies while overcoming
      their defenses. You gain the following benefits.</p><p><strong>Fortune
      Teller.</strong> When you finish a Short or Long Rest, roll 1d6 and record
      the result. When you cast a spell using an Orb as a Spellcasting Focus,
      you can add the result of this prescience roll to your spell attack roll,
      or reduce one target’s saving throw by that amount. You must choose to do
      so before the attack roll or saving throw.</p><p>Once you use this
      benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
      Unused prescience rolls are lost when you finish a Short or Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>See the Path.</strong> While you are holding an Orb,
      Opportunity Attacks against you have Disadvantage.</p><p><strong>Prescient
      Escape.</strong> While you are holding an Orb, whenever a creature you can
      see enters a space within 5 feet of you, you can use your Reaction to move
      up to your Speed without provoking an Opportunity Attack.</p>
