      <p>Starting at 1st level, you can flaunt your freedom while constraining
      would-be pursuers. When an enemy moves within 5 feet of you, you can use
      your reaction to immediately move up to your speed. This movement does not
      provoke an opportunity attack from the triggering enemy. Additionally, the
      triggering enemy must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, its speed
      becomes 0 until the end of its next turn, and it canâ€™t benefit from any
      bonus to its speed for the duration. The save DC is equal to your warlock
      spell save DC.</p><p> When you use this ability, you must finish a short
      rest before you can use it again.</p>
