    value: >-
      <p>You can use your Channel Divinity when you hit a creature with a weapon
      attack, or as an action against a creature you can see, to mark it as the
      target of your divine hunt. While marked in this way, the creature cannot
      benefit from being hidden or invisible, and you know whether it is within
      500 feet of you or not (but not where). Additionally, whenever one of your
      allies makes a melee attack against the creature, you can use your
      reaction to grant that attack advantage. On a hit, it deals an additional
      1d8 radiant damage. The mark lasts until either you or the creature is
      reduced to 0 hit points, or you choose to mark a different creature before
      that happens</p>
