    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 11th level, when you make a Strength (Athletics) or
      Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, you can spend 1 ki point to roll an
      additional d20. You can choose to use this ability after you roll the
      check, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s
      is used for the ability check, omitting the highest if this check was
      rolled with disadvantage. </p><p>In addition, the extra damage dealt by
      the Manifest Blow class feature increases to 2d6.</p>
