    value: >-
      <p>You focus everything on bringing your chosen target down. When you take
      the Attack action and target only one creature with all your attacks, you
      can make an additional attack against that creature. If the additional
      attack is a melee attack and it hits, the target has either the Grappled
      or Prone condition (your choice). If the additional attack is a ranged
      attack and it hits, the target has the Prone condition.</p>
