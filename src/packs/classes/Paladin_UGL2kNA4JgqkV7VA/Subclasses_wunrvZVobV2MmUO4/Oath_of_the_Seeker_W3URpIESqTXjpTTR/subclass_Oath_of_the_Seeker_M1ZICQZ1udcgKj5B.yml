      <p>The Blood of Vol teaches its adherents that we must stand together, for
      the world is cruel and there are no gods to help us. Those who take this
      incredibly seriously sometimes swear an oath to protect their community,
      working to achieve their own divinity while helping others achieve
      theirs.</p><p>Those who take the Oath of the Seeker prioritize others over
      themselves, channeling the power of Mabar into something positive. Many of
      these individuals became bone knights when Kaius I made the Blood of Vol
      the official state religion, only to be abandoned by the country they
      served. For some, this drove them to groups like the Emerald Claw, but for
      others it only strengthened their faith. No one else will save us, we must
      look out for each other.</p><h3>Tenets of the Seeker</h3><p>The tenets of
      the Oath of the Seeker drive a paladin to prioritize the safety of others
      and to fight for their community and loved
      ones.</p><p><strong>Community.</strong> If the gods exist, they are cruel
      and unfeeling. They can’t save us, so we can only save each other. Don’t
      ignore the suffering of others, for there is no one else who will
      help.</p><p><strong>Divinity.</strong> Strive to cultivate your divine
      spark. Reflect on your actions and their consequences, consider what kind
      of fledgling god you will become. Do not make excuses for your mistakes,
      learn from them. This is the work of a
      lifetime.</p><p><strong>Life.</strong> There is no afterlife. Death is the
      end, and every death is a tragedy. Kill only as a last resort, and fight
      to preserve those who can be saved.</p><p><strong>Martyrdom.</strong>
      Death is the end, and a corpse is just a corpse. Should you fail to reach
      the Divinity Within, let your body continue to serve your community in any
      way it can.</p>
