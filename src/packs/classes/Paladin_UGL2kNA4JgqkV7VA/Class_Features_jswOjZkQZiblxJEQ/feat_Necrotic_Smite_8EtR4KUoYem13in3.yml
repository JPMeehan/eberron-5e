    value: >-
      <p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one
      spell slot to deal Necrotic or Radiant damage to the target, in addition
      to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell
      slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.
      The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is a Celestial or a Fiend, to a
      maximum of 6d8.</p>
