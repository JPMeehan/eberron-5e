      <p>Your unarmed strikes are considered adamantine weapons. In addition,
      when you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you can spend 1 ki point
      to cause it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the
      creature takes 2d6 additional damage of the same type as the unarmed
      strike and can be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. On a successful
      save, the creature only takes 1d6 points of additional damage and is not
      pushed back.</p>
