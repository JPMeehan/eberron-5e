      <p>The course of your life was forever thrown off-kilter by the schemes of
      those plotting your downfall; now, your heart burns with the goal of
      hunting those who wronged you, empowered by your zeal and desire for
      vengeance. Perhaps you made a deal with a powerful entity to give you the
      tools for murder, or made a binding oath to right the wrongs of the past;
      regardless, you are now an arrow loosed on a single path, and none can run
      from the bite of your steel. Revenger rogues are experts at social
      manipulation, gathering information on their foes by reading people’s dark
      desires - all to bring low the targets of their vendettas.</p><p> In
      Eberron, Revengers might arise from any number of situations. In Xen’drik,
      the overlord known as the Scar that Abides is an incarnation of cold rage,
      and empowers his servants to violently deal with perceived slights against
      him. The Spinner of Shadows also gives dark pacts to those seeking
      revenge, changing their destinies to spread pain and suffering through the
      land. Revengers can also arise through sincere personal oaths. Those who
      lost everything in the Last War, Cyran avengers, and followers of the Fury
      might all walk down this dark path.</p>
