    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, you can damn a creature to the worst possible fate,
      consigning it to a rapid demise. As an action, you can choose a creature
      that you can see within 60 feet of you and curse it to a doomed destiny.
      The creature has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and
      saving throws, and all attack rolls against it have advantage. The effect
      lasts until removed by a spell such as remove curse, or until you lose
      concentration on the effect (as though concentrating on a spell). You can
      use this ability multiple times, but subsequent uses after the first
      require you to expend a 5th-level spell slot. You regain the ability to
      use this feature without expending a spell slot upon completing a long
      rest.</p>
