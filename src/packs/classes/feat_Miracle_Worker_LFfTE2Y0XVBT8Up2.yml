      <p>You ignite the divine spark within your creations, causing them to
      flare with radiant power. This feature grants you two
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Wrath</strong>. As a reaction to a character you
      can see hitting an enemy with a weapon that you have infused, you can
      cause the attack to deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage, and force the
      target to make a Constitution saving throw against your Spell Save DC. On
      a failure, they are blinded until the end of their next
      turn.</p><p><strong>Refuge</strong>. Alternatively, when an ally you can
      see who is wearing or carrying an item you have infused is hit by an
      attack or fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant them
      temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your artificer level before the damage
      resolves. You can use this feature to grant temporary hit points a number
      of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses
      when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Both reactions increase to 2d8 at 11th
      level</p>
