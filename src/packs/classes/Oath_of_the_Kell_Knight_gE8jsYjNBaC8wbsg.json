      "value": "<p>The legendary Daughters of Sora Kell occasionally choose champions, marked by a specific brand. Though their influence nearly equals that of the Droaamish warlords, more often than not, the Knights of Kell are bound only to the service of these enigmatic hag queens. Natives of Droaam recognize the brand of a Kell Knight, but elsewhere in the world, the Mark of Kell draws indifference or passing curiosity. As knights continue in service, the rewards gifted by their patrons increase exponentially, but few survive long enough to see the pinnacle of their knighthood due to their bizarre and dangerous missions.</p><p>Although most Kell Knights are in Droaam, they can be found across the Five Nations, serving the interests of the Daughters. Sora Teraza has been known to recruit servitors via their dreams, and these dream-bound knights can be found anywhere.</p><h5>Tenets of the Kell Knight</h5><p>Emissaries of the enigmatic Queens of Droaam adhere to the Rule of Three. This oath places importance on power, whether it be physical or mental. The tenets are said to be ideals held by the Night Mother herself.</p><p><em><strong>By Hook.</strong></em> Your actions should import your mission’s weight. Callous cruelty is unnecessary, but everyone must know their place. Respect the chain of command and assert your authority.</p><p><em><strong>By Crook.</strong></em> A fool is friend to many, but used by all. Guile and deception are at your disposal to complete your objectives. A competent knight always has a plan.</p><p><em><strong>By Book.</strong></em> Knowledge is a universal commodity. Whether it be advantage over your foes or long-kept secrets, you always strive to learn and to share that information—for a price. <br /></p>",
