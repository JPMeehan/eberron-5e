      <p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to enhance the weapons of your
      squad, targeting the damage to the weakness of your enemies. As an action,
      you can activate an aura that extends from you in a 30-foot radius. The
      aura moves with you, centered on you, and lasts for 1 minute or until your
      concentration ends (as if you were casting a spell). </p><p>When you
      activate this aura, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold,
      fire, lightning, or thunder. Each creature of your choice in the aura
      deals an extra 1d4 damage of the chosen type when it hits with a weapon
      attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
      Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses
      after a long rest.</p>
