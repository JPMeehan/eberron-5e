    value: >-
      <p>When a mortal mind is touched by a power and an understanding far
      beyond what they can comprehend, one of two things happen. The unlucky
      ones inevitably lose their sanity, muttering incomprehensible passages
      that others dismiss as imaginary tales. The lucky ones? They survive, but
      not as they once were, changed by the revelations that they experienced.
      While these creatures can have incredible insight, they pay a price that
      separates them from the rest of the world.</p><p>Most people call Xoriat
      the Plane of Madness. But to those that have touched it and truly known
      it, Xoriat is the Plane of Revelations, and it has birthed great bards of
      this college. Some learn the truth due to direct exposure to the plane,
      others through attempting to translate texts written by those that Knew
      before; either way, they learn that which is hidden to all but a
      few.</p><p>Though extraplanar influence is the most common, other paths
      also lead to the College of Revelation. Perhaps the Shadow of the Dark Six
      gifted a determined seeker with dangerous arcane secrets that were shunned
      by conventional schools of arcane magic, or perhaps an innocent stumbled
      on them unwittingly with the help of a Keeper of Secrets such as Sul
      Khatesh. </p>
