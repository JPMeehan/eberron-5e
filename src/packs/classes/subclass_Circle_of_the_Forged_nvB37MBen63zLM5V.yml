      <p>What is truly natural? The warforged are living creatures, despite
      being constructed from wood and steel. Druids who embrace the Circle of
      the Forged explore the potential of the warforged form, blending animal
      shapes with warforged durability. This is a young path, pioneered by a
      handful of warforged who sought a greater understanding of their role in
      the world. Over the last few decades, a number of warforged have embraced
      the Circle of the Forged; however, it isn’t limited to warforged; a
      Cannith heir or an aspiring artificer might pursue primal power as a way
      to transcend the limited flesh they were born with.</p><p>Only a handful
      of druids follow this Circle. Did you learn these techniques from a
      mentor? Are you driven by instinct, still learning what you’re capable of?
      Or, if you’re a warforged, were you designed with the potential to assume
      multiple forms . . . and if so, who created you, and why?</p>
