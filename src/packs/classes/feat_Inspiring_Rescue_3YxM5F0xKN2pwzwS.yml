    value: >-
      <p>When you hit a creature with your Saviorâ€™s Strike, or grant them a
      spell with Break the Chains, all allies within 30 feet of that creature
      can use their reaction to move up their speed as they wish without
      provoking opportunity attacks. Additionally, any creature that moves in
      this way gains temporary hit points equal to your Paladin level + your
      Charisma modifier</p>
