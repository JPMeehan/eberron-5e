    value: >-
      <p>You can inflict your enemies with paranoia, causing them to strike
      their allies. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic
      Inspiration to force a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet of you
      that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature automatically
      succeeds on this save if it is immune to being frightened. On a failed
      save, the target must immediately use its reaction (if available) to make
      one melee weapon attack against a creature of your choice within its
      reach. On a hit, the attack deals extra damage equal to the number rolled
      on the Bardic Inspiration die.</p>
