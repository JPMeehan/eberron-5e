    value: >-
      <p>When you cast summon beast, summon fey, summon elemental, summon
      celestial, or summon fiend, you can spend a number of sorcerer points
      equal to the level at which you cast the spell in order to alter the
      spell’s magic so that you subsume it into yourself. When you cast one of
      these spells this way, the spell does not require concentration.
      Additionally, when you cast these spells this way, instead of manifesting
      a spirit within the spell’s range, you transform yourself into the
      creature you would manifest.</p><p>While transformed, your game statistics
      are replaced by the statistics of the manifested creature, but you retain
      your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores,
      your languages, and your ability to cast spells. Your transformation lasts
      for the duration of the spell, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die.
      When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit
      points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of
      dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal
      form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0
      hit points, you don’t lose consciousness</p>
