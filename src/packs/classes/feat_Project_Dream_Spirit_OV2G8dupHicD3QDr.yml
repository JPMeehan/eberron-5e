    value: >-
      <p>You gain the ability to project a spirit of dreams and nightmares into
      reality. You can call forth this dream spirit as an action, and it
      manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within 90 feet of you.
      This corporeal form uses the
      @UUID[Compendium.eberron-5e.bestiary.Actor.CoKtmiQhTHaapgqc]{Dream Spirit}
      stat block. Whenever you call forth this spirit, choose an emotion:
      Despair, Fear, Fury, Joy, or Pride. The creature resembles a quori spirit
      tied to each emotion; du’ulora (Fury), hashalaq (Joy), kalaraq (Pride),
      tsucora or tsoreva (Fear), or usvapna (Despair). Your choice determines
      certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to
      0 hit points, or until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>The creature
      is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your
      initiative count, but it takes its turns immediately after yours. It obeys
      your telepathic commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue
      any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid
      danger.</p><p>You can use this feature once, and you regain the ability to
      do so when you finish a long rest. You can also use this feature by
      expending a spell slot. You can only have one dream spirit manifested at a
      time; if you use this feature again while the first dream spirit still
      exists, the older dream spirit disappears.</p>
