  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you use your Furyâ€™s Revelry feature, you can empower your song
      into a magnificent and malign crescendo. Rather than affecting just one
      target of the triggering spell, you can instead affect each hostile
      creature that you hit with that attack or that failed its saving throw
      against that spell. </p><p>You can use this ability a number of times
      equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.</p>
