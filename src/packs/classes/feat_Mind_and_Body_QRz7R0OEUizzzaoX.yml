      <p>You have honed your mind into a weapon as potent as your body. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><p><strong>Psionic Strike</strong>. When you
      hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to deal
      extra force damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your
      Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature only once per
      turn.</p><p><strong>Telekinetic Assault</strong>. You have mastered the
      use of telekinesis in combat, able to launch debris and bolts of force at
      distant enemies. You gain a new attack option that you can use with the
      Attack action. The special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of
      30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Wisdom modifier to
      its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is bludgeoning or force (your
      choice), and its damage die is equivalent to your martial arts
      die.</p><p>When you take the Attack action on your turn and use this
      special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 ki point to make the special
      attack twice as a bonus action. When you gain the Extra Attack feature,
      this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of
      the Attack action</p>
