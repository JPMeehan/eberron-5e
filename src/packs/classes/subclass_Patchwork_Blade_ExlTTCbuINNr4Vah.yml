      <p>‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’ is normally a joke for
      adventurers. Patchwork Blades are those who take it to the extreme. These
      bestial warriors take on the strength of the creatures they hunt, growing
      in monstrous power with every victory. As consummate hunters, Patchwork
      Blades study their prey, making use of their weaknesses. When you fight
      the ultimate hunters, it takes one to know one. Some Blades believe that
      they receive strength from the gods with every kill. Others take a more
      direct route, and physically alter their own forms using the magical blood
      or remnants of their prey. Regardless, all are a fearsome sight, and stray
      further and further from mortality with each notch in the
      axe.</p><p>Patchwork Blades can be flavored in different ways, and can be
      found in a variety of places within Eberron as a result. The greatest
      number form part of the Wyrd Vigil of Vralkast, taking on the horrors of
      Khyber and warping themselves to defend their city. The disciples of the
      daelkyr Dyrrn the Corruptor might also travel such a path, taking the body
      parts of their prey to further their own evolution. Some changelings,
      especially the doppelgangers of Lost, take the opposite approach - they
      study and mimic the forms of others to master their shapechanging
      techniques. Those Patchwork Blades who take on the spiritual strength of
      their prey tend to belong to druidic communities, as well as Stormreach’s
      Lords of the Hunt. The goliaths of the Blood of Kanda see The Hunt to be a
      religious ritual, and take on the aspects of the dragons and leviathans of
      the Dark Sea that they slay in their duties.</p>
