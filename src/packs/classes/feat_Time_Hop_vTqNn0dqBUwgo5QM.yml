    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, your mind is evolving, and you not only view time as an
      artificial construct, but you know how to bend it.</p><p>As an action, you
      can touch a creature within 5 feet of you, causing it to make a Wisdom
      saving throw against your ki save DC; a creature can choose to fail this
      save if it wishes. On a failed save, it disappears in a shimmer of energy
      and is transported forwards in time 3 rounds. Other creatures cannot
      perceive, interact with, or affect it in any way during that time, and the
      target is incapacitated, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its
      surroundings. The target must repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of
      each of your turns, ending the effect early on a success. Regardless of
      whether it succeeds or fails, after rolling 3 saving throws at the end of
      each of your turns, the effect ends and the target returns to the present
      time in the space it previously occupied. If it would arrive back into a
      place already occupied by another creature or object, both take 1d6 points
      of force damage, and the target appears in an unoccupied space nearest to
      it. On its return, from the target's point of view, no time has passed at
      all.</p><p>Alternatively, as an action, you can touch a nonmagical object
      that isn't worn or carried and weighs no more than 300 pounds. It
      disappears in a shimmer of energy and is transported forwards in time 3
      rounds. Creatures cannot perceive, interact with, or affect it in any way
      during that time. 3 rounds later, at the end of your turn, the object
      returns to the present time in the space it previously occupied, in
      exactly the same orientation and condition as before. If it would arrive
      back into a place already occupied by another object or a creature, both
      take 1d6 points of force damage, and the object appears in an unoccupied
      space nearest to it.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times
      equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended
      uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
