    value: >-
      <p>You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see, provided the
      creature is within a number of feet of you equal to 10 times your level in
      this class. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to
      understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to
      understand at least one language.</p><p>When you're using this feature to
      speak telepathically to a creature, you can spend 1 sorcery point as an
      action to give that creature the ability to speak telepathically with you
      for 1 hour or until you end this effect as an action. To use this ability,
      the creature must be able to see you and must be within range of your
      ability to speak telepathically with them. You can grant this ability to
      multiple creatures at the same time, and all creatures that have this
      ability can hear the telepathic utterances of yourself and all other
      creatures with the ability, allowing you to converse telepathically as a
      group. The number of creatures you can grant this telepathic ability to at
      the same time equals 1 plus your Intelligence or Charisma modifier
      (minimum 2 creatures besides yourself); giving it to a creature that would
      exceed this amount causes the ability to end for the creature with the
      ability who was granted it for the longest amount of time.</p>
