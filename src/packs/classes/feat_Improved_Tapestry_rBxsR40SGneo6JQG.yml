      <p>Starting at 9th level, you can blanket your allies in a weave of
      bolstering spellwork. When you cast a prepared spell that targets only one
      creature, doesn't have a range of self, and is of a level no higher than
      your artificer level divided by four, you can choose for that spell to
      affect every creature within 60 feet of you that is part of your tapestry.
      In addition, they all gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your
      artificer level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
      you finish a short or long rest.</p>
