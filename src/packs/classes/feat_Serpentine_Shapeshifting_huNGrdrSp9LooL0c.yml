      <p>At 1st level, you learn to adopt the form of a serpent. As a bonus
      action, you can turn into a Tiny or Small snake. During this time, you
      keep your racial traits, ability scores, and ability to speak and cast
      spells. Spells cast in this form do not require somatic components. You
      also gain blindsight to 10 feet. This transformation lasts for one hour,
      until you take damage, or until you use a bonus action to end it. You can
      use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier per
      long rest.</p><p> Additionally, at 3rd level, you can cast alter self
      either by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot as
      normal. If you cast it with sorcery points, you may select all three
      options — Aquatic Adaptation, Change Appearance, and Natural Weapons — at
      once</p>
