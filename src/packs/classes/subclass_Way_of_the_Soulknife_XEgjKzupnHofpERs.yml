    value: >-
      <p>Monks who adhere to the Way of the Soulknife meditate on the nature of
      the self and reality, and learn to cut through all perceived barriers,
      both within themselves and between others.</p><p>By recognizing these
      barriers within themselves, these “soulknives” can remove the borders
      between mind, soul, and body, allowing them to use their ki power to
      physically manifest blades of pure psionic energy from their fists.</p>
