    value: >-
      <p>You gain the ability to channel the strength and power of nature in
      battle. As a bonus action while you are not wearing heavy armor, you can
      expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a forest form, rather
      than transforming into a beast. The form lasts for 10 minutes. While in
      your Forest Form, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain a
      bonus to your armor class equal to your proficiency bonus.</li><li>As long
      as you are in contact with the ground, the ground in a 10 foot radius
      around you becomes difficult terrain for creatures of your
      choosing.</li><li>You can cast thorn whip as a bonus action.</li></ul>
