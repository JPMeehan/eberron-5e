    value: >-
      <p>When you strike your foes, you can summon the fires and tremors of the
      earth, the thunder of the clouds, and the lashing waves of the sea.
      Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1
      ki point to use one of the following magical effects. You can choose a new
      effect each time you use this feature</p><p><strong>Earthen
      Tremor</strong>. You strike the ground and cause a disruptive tremor to
      emanate in a 5-foot radius from a point you can see on the ground within
      15 feet of you. Each creature in contact with the ground within the area
      must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
      bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier and is knocked
      prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes
      difficult terrain until cleared (requiring at least 1 minute of manual
      labor to do so by hand). This effect’s damage dice increases when you
      reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level
      (4d4).</p><p><strong>Flame Bolt</strong>. Make a ranged spell attack
      against a creature or object within 120 feet of you. On a hit, the target
      takes fire damage equal to 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier. A flammable object
      hit by this effect ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried. This
      effect’s damage dice increases when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level
      (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p><p><strong>Thunder Impact</strong>. Make
      a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of you. On a hit,
      the target takes thunder damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier and
      you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw, pushing it
      10 feet directly away from you and knocking it prone on a failed saving
      throw. This effect’s damage dice increases when you reach 5th level (2d8),
      11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p><p><strong>Water Whip</strong>.
      Choose a source of water that you can see within 60 feet of you that has a
      volume of at least 1 liter. Make a melee spell attack against a creature
      within 30 feet of the source of water. On a hit, the target takes slashing
      damage equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier and you can force the creature
      to make a Strength saving throw, pulling it up to 10 feet towards the body
      of water on a failed saving throw. This effect’s damage dice increases
      when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6)</p>
