    value: >-
      <p>The bone transmutes into a rough key shape, and it gains the ability to
      mold to locks it is placed in. The key has 6 charges. The wielder can
      expend a charge of the key and place it into a lock for 1 minute, at the
      end of which the key can unlock the lock as if it were made for the lock.
      The key remains in this configuration until this property is used
      again.</p>
