      <p>Divine Crucibles are the smiths of the gods, forging relics in radiant
      flame. Their craftwork is belief, and their belief lies in the glory of
      their craft. When heroes seek out blessed weapons to smite evil, it’s
      Crucibles who provide. It is said that each one places a divine spark in
      their masterpieces; in battle, they can ignite these sparks, causing the
      relics to flare with holy fire, and bolster their wielders.</p><p>
      Crucibles can be found across Eberron, serving the Silver Flame, or gods
      of the forge such as Onatar. The Ghaash’kala and Shulassakar both rely on
      skilled Crucibles to forge and shape songsilver - the unbreakable essence
      of the couatl. In Xen’drik, the fire giants of the Torch of Progress see
      the silver flame as a force for peace and enlightenment, and create items
      to support the people. Their kin within the hidden city of Daomon once
      powered their forges with the Fernian fires of Onatar, creating sacred
      relics of the Sovereigns - though the Shattering has scattered their works
      to the ashes of time</p>
