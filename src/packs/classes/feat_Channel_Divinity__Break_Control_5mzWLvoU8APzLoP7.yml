    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to free others
      from mind control.</p><p> As an action, you present your holy symbol, and
      each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of
      you that is charmed or otherwise mentally controlled can immediately make
      a new save against the conditions affecting its mind. The DC is the same
      as the original effect.</p>
