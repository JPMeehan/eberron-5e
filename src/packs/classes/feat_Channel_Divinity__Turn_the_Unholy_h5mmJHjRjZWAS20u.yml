    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring
      fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that
      can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw.
      If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until
      it takes damage.</p><p> A turned creature must spend its turns trying to
      move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a
      space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action,
      it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that
      prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use
      the Dodge action</p>
