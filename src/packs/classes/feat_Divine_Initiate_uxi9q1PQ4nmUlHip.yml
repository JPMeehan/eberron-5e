      <p>Whenever you gain a wizard level, you can replace one of the wizard
      spells you add to your spellbook with a paladin spell. The spell must be
      of a level for which you have spell slots. Any paladin spell you gain from
      this feature is considered a wizard spell for you, but other wizards can't
      copy paladin spells from your spellbook into their own spellbooks.</p><p>
      Additionally, you can use a Holy Symbol as a spellcasting focus for your
      wizard spells</p>
