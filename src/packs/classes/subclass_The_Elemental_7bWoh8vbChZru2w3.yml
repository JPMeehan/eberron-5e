    value: >-
      <p>Unlike most warlocks, you didnâ€™t make a deal with a powerful mysterious
      patron. Rather, you found an elemental; perhaps it was already bound,
      perhaps you bound it yourself, or perhaps found the spark deep within your
      own spirit. Regardless of your methodology, you are the master of this
      relationship, and you take what you need from it without being at its beck
      and call.</p><p>The Sulatar drow of the Xen'drik jungles are true masters
      of the art of elemental binding, able to control bound fire elementals
      without need for a dragonmark. Binding a fire elemental to their soul is
      merely an extension of that ability.</p><p>Gnomes of Zilargo are also
      known to follow this path as a result of their own elemental binding
      skills, and though they lack the same fundamental connection as the
      Sulatar, they are far more varied in their elemental types.</p><p>Far more
      rarely, planetouched folks might have a deep, intrinsic connection to an
      outer plane that exemplifies an elemental as part of their very nature.
      Such creatures as genasi or tieflings of Fernia have a connection to the
      elements that's deeper even than the Sulatar, and their bond can reach
      depths that the drow of Xen'drik can only dream of. </p>
