      <p>Bone Knights are Karrn patriots, living protectors who fight alongside
      the undead legions of their land. During the Last War, they provided
      tactical expertise and controlled the legions of undead that the Blood of
      Vol priesthood raised to defend the Karrnathi people.</p><p>Although the
      founders of the order of Bone Knights were powerful members of the Emerald
      Claw, they recruited freely from amongst the populace, seeking those with
      the ability and willpower to control the dead, rather than prioritizing
      matters of faith. In post-war Karrnath, the surviving Bone Knights are
      elite emissaries who travel abroad to complete missions that serve the
      greater glory of Karrnath and King Kaius III. The only recognized Bone
      Knight training facilities are located in Karrnath, and most come from
      that grim land. However, the Order of the Emerald Claw pioneered the
      order, so a new trainee could crop up anywhere their reach
      extends.</p><p>Though unknown to most of Khorvaire, similar traditions
      exist amongst the elves of the Bloodsail Principality and in Aerenal
      itself. Rumors of an ancient and powerful group of elven necromancers in
      the Xen'drik jungles could also lead to this path.</p><h5><span
      class="fontstyle0">T</span>enets of the Bone Knight</h5><p>Sworn to the
      service of Karrnath, these knights follow a simple
      code.</p><p><em><strong>Never Bow Down.</strong></em> You are the elite.
      Do not kneel to one who has not proven your superior unless ordered by the
      Crown.</p><p><em><strong>Hold Firm.</strong></em> Commanding legions of
      undead requires an iron will and confidence. Resist temptations and do not
      make excuses for poor behavior. Learn from your mistakes so that you do
      not repeat them.</p><p><em><strong>Bound by Loyalty.</strong></em> Your
      word is your life. Once you have sworn your service to another, you will
      serve to death and beyond, if necessary. However, if they prove unworthy
      of your service, dispense the necessary judgment and find another who is
      worthy. <br /></p>
