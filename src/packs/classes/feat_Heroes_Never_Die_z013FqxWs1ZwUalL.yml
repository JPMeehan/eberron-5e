      <p>At 18th level, your allies have no fear of death in your presence. As a
      reaction, if another creature within 60 feet of you that you can see would
      drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, you can cause it to
      drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this feature a number of times
      equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all
      expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
