    value: >-
      <p>When you cast one of your Oath spells, you can expend your Channel
      Divinity while doing so to grant that spell to a willing ally you can see
      within 60 feet of you. The spell takes effect as though that ally had cast
      it from their position, allowing them to choose any targets of the spell
      if it has a range other than self. If the spell requires concentration,
      you maintain concentration when cast in this way.</p>
