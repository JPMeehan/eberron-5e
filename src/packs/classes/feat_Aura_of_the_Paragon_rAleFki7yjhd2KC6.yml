    value: >-
      <p>You emanate an aura that evokes the storied history of your patron
      ancestor, filling you and your companions with hope and drive. When you
      use your Divine Smite, friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can use
      their reaction to gain your ancestor’s favor until the end of their next
      turn. Creatures with your ancestor’s favor deal an extra 1d4 radiant
      damage the next time they hit with an attack.</p><p> When you reach 18th
      level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
