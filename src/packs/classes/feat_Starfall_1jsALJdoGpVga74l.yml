      <p>Starting at 14th level, the Dragon Above may bestow upon you a rare
      gift. As an action, you can call a Siberys dragonshard to fall from the
      sky and strike the ground within 120 feet of you. Each creature in a
      20-foot-radius sphere centered on the point you choose must make a
      Dexterity saving throw, with DC equal to your warlock spell save DC. An
      affected creature takes 8d6 radiant damage and 8d6 bludgeoning damage on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. The bludgeoning
      damage is considered to be magical. After the impact, the ground within
      the affected area costs 2 feet of speed for every 1 foot moved.</p><p>At
      the DM's discretion, using this ability underground or indoors might cause
      the dragonshard to fall dramatically and violently through the ceiling.
      Otherwise, the shard manifests spontaneously at the target area before
      exploding.</p><p>The ability damages objects in the area and ignites
      flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. The dragonshard is
      destroyed on impact.</p><p> When you use this ability, you must finish a
      long rest before you can use it again.</p>
