    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you
      can choose to bind it within the strings of fate. The creature must
      succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or become
      restrained. The creature can repeat the Strength saving throw at the end
      of each of their turns to end the effect. You can use this feature a
      number of times equal to your proficiency modifier, and regain all
      expended uses upon completing a long rest.</p><p> When an enemy creature
      restrained in this way is reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to steal
      part of their fate for yourself, by rolling one d20 and recording the
      number rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability
      check made by you or a creature that you can see with this foretelling
      roll. You must choose to do so before the roll. The foretelling roll can
      be used only once, and is lost when you finish a long rest. You can only
      have one foretelling roll at a time, and lose a held roll if you choose to
      roll for another.</p>
