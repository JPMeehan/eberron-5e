      <p>At 1st level, you have keen insight into the targets of your spells.
      Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against a warlock spell you cast
      of 1st level or higher, you learn your choice of the creature's highest or
      lowest saving throw and its value. As a reaction, you can more closely
      read the threads of Prophecy woven into it, choosing to either learn all
      of the creature's condition immunities, or to learn all of its damage
      resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities.</p>
