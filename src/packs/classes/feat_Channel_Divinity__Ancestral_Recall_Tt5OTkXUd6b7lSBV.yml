    value: >-
      <p>As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to call to mind a
      great deed of your ancestor. Choose one skill and choose one tool or
      language that your ancestor was skilled in during their life. For the next
      10 minutes, you are proficient in any chosen skill or tool, and your
      proficiency bonus is doubled for each ability check you make using a
      chosen proficiency. If you choose a language, you can speak, read, and
      write that language for the duration.</p>
