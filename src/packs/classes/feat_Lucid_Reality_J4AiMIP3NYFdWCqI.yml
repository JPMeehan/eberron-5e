      <p>Your fundamental connection to the realm of dreams weakens the barrier
      between it and the waking world. You learn the spell mirage arcane, which
      you can scribe into your spellbook at no cost. You count as having the
      spell prepared at all times, which does not count towards your prepared
      spell limit.</p><p>Additionally, while inside your mirage arcane, you can
      create one of the following effects at the start of your turn, warping
      reality into a surreal dreamscape. All effects end upon leaving the area
      of the spell. The effects are:</p><ul><li>All melee weapons become
      oversized; a character wielding a melee weapon deals an additional 1d8
      weapon damage on a hit.</li><li>When a creature ends their turn within 30
      feet of you, you can use your reaction to force them to make a Dexterity
      saving throw. On a failure, a hidden trap or feature of the landscape
      pushes them 20 feet horizontally in a direction of your
      choice.</li><li>All creatures within the illusion gain a flying speed
      equal to their walking speed up to a maximum height equal to the length of
      the affected area.</li><li>All creatures gain disadvantage on saving
      throws against Illusion and Enchantment spells.</li></ul>
