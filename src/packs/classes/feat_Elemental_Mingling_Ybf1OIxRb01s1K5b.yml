    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, your long exposure has gifted you with traits
      normally associated with elementals. You gain resistance to poison damage
      and to your elemental affinity type. If you were already resistant to your
      affinity type as a racial feature, you instead gain immunity to your
      elemental affinity type.</p><p>In addition, you have advantage on saves
      against being paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and stunned, and magic can't
      put you to sleep.</p>
