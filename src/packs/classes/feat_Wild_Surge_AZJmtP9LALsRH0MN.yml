    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 1st level, you learn to spark a wild surge of emotion that
      can enhance your powers or overwhelm them. Once on your turn, you can roll
      a d6, your Wild Surge die, when you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or
      higher. On a roll of 2 or higher, you can cast the spell as if from a
      spell slot one level greater than the slot you expended. If you roll a 1,
      you fail and are overcome by the rising tide of emotion; your spell is not
      cast, the spell slot is unexpended, and you are incapacitated until the
      start of your next turn. Your Wild Surge cannot increase the effective
      level of a spell beyond 9th level.</p><p>Your Wild Surge die changes when
      you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 11th
      level, and a d10 at 17th level.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of
      times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any
      expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
