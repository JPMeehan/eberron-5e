      <p>While this Mutagen is active, you have resistance to acid damage, and
      do not expend extra movement when squeezing through small
      spaces.</p><p>Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks to
      grapple other creatures, or avoid being grappled. When you attack a
      creature that you have grappled, or is grappling you, you deal an
      additional 1d4 acid damage on a hit.</p>
