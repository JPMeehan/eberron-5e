    value: >-
      <p>Also at 3rd level, you fight with cocky flair, but aren't afraid to
      gain the upper hand by kicking sand in your foe's face, taunting them, or
      yelling 'Behind you!' to distract them.</p><p>As a bonus action, choose
      one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and select one of the
      following effects. The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a
      weapon attack, it takes 1d6 extra damage from the attack and suffers the
      chosen effect:</p><ul><li>The creature's speed is reduced to 0 until the
      start of your next turn.</li><li>Cause the creature to make a Strength
      (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your attack roll.
      If your attack roll is higher, it is disarmed and drops one weapon it is
      holding.</li><li>Grant yourself advantage on the next weapon attack you
      make against the creature in the next minute.</li></ul><p>When you reach
      11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d6.</p>
