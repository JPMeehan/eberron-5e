    value: >-
      <p>Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you can
      spend 1 ki point to rend your target and inflict deep bleeding wounds. At
      the start of each of the creature’s turns for the next minute, it takes
      1d4 points of slashing damage from this effect. The effect ends early if
      the creature has one or more hit points restored, if any creature uses its
      action to expend one use of a healer’s kit, or makes a successful Wisdom
      (Medicine) check with a DC equal to your ki save DC. </p><p>When you reach
      6th level, this slashing damage counts as magical for the purpose of
      overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
