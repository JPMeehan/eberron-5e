    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, your form becomes serpentine and flexible, allowing you
      to move unnaturally and get yourself out of trouble. You have advantage on
      saving throws against being paralyzed or restrained by magic, and can
      spend five feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or a
      creature that has you grappled.</p>
