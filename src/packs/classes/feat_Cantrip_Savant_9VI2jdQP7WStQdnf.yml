    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 5th level, you continue to develop your talent for the
      simplest spells. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>When
      casting an artificer cantrip, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and to
      your artificer spell save DC unless your spellcasting focus grants a
      higher bonus. This bonus increases when you reach certain levels in this
      class, increasing to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 15th
      level.</p></li><li><p>As an action, you can replace an artificer cantrip
      you know with a different cantrip from the artificer spell list or your
      Breakthrough spell list. Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again
      until you finish a long rest.</p></li></ul>
