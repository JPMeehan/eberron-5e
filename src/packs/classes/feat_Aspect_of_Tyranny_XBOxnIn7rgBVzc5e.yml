  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The fiendish presence in your demonshard revels in the pain it has
      wrought. When a creature takes damage from your Fiendish Punishment or
      Overflowing Malice features, you can use your Reaction to cause one
      affected creature to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your
      Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). The creature suffers a -1
      penalty to its saving throw for each other creature affected by Fiendish
      Punishment or Overflowing Malice on the same turn. On a failed save, the
      creature takes 1d10 Necrotic damage and has the Frightened condition for 1
      minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creatureâ€™s turns, the
      creature repeats the save (without a penalty), ending the effect on itself
      on a success.</p>
