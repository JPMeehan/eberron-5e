      <p>Bards of the College of the Dirge Singer are trained to inspire their
      people and direct soldiers on the battlefield. Students of both history
      and war, dirge singers use tales of past glory and their knowledge of
      great victories to inspire their allies and provide keen strategic
      insight, directing allies to strike when enemies are weak.</p><p>This
      ancient tradition was developed in the Empire of Dhakaan, and is largely
      unknown beyond the goblinoids of the Kech Dhakaan. The duur’kala—Goblin
      for dirge singer— are the historians, diplomats, and spiritual leaders of
      the empire. Duur’kala are discussed in more detail in chapter 4 of this
      book. If you’re not one of the dar, consider how you came to learn this
      tradition. Did you train with a ghaal’dar mentor? Or did you find your own
      path to these techniques?</p>
