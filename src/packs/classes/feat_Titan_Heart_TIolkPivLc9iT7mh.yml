    value: >-
      <p>Your Behemoth Shape grows in its awesome power. The benefits you gain
      when transforming into a Large or larger creature improve, replacing their
      previous effects:</p><ul><li><strong>Thick Hide</strong>. You gain a +3
      bonus to your armor class.</li><li><strong>Primal Strength</strong>. You
      gain advantage on Strength ability checks and saving throws, and deal
      double damage to objects and structures.</li><li><strong>Powerful
      Blows</strong>. Your first attack that hits on your turn deals an
      additional 1d8 damage. Additionally, your attacks count as
      magical.</li><li><strong>Predatory Instincts</strong>. If you critically
      hit a creature, every hostile creature within 10 feet of you must succeed
      on a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC or become frightened
      of you. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
      each of their turns to end the effect.</li></ul>
