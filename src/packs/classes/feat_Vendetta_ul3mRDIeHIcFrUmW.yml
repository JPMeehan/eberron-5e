    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, the depths of your vengeance know no bounds. As a
      reaction to a creature dealing damage to you or publicly insulting you,
      you can curse it with a Vendetta. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a
      creature marked by your Vendetta, the damage die become d8s instead of the
      usual d6s. You can maintain a maximum number of Vendettas equal to your
      proficiency bonus, and must choose one to replace if you would gain
      another while at your maximum. Vendettas last until replaced by you, or
      until removed by a spell such as remove curse.</p><p> Additionally, you
      gain proficiency in Deception. If you already have proficiency, your
      proficiency bonus is instead doubled for Deception checks.</p>
