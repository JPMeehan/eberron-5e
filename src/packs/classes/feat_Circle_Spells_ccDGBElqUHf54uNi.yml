      <p>You learn the thorn whip cantrip. Additionally, your bond to the land
      itself grants you access to additional spells when you reach certain
      levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of the Verdant Spells
      table.</p><p>Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have
      them prepared, and they donâ€™t count against the number of spells you can
      prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the
      Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>
