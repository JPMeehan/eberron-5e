      <p>The Oath of Freedom is a vow to fight back against the tyrants,
      conquerors, and slavers who would use their power to oppress others.
      Paladins who swear this oath believe that all have the right to dictate
      their own path, and often act as noble revolutionaries and freedom
      fighters. When an invading army oppresses a nation, when a tyrant king
      imprisons his people, or a criminal group begins dealing in lives, that is
      when the Oath of Freedom rises.</p><p>In Xen’drik, both the Unbound
      Brigade and the Silaes Tairn often embody the Oath, fighting against the
      giants who once enslaved them and their kin. Their sworn enemies are those
      such as the Battalion of Basalt Towers, who would use ancient magic to
      rule over the continent once more. In Khorvaire, Oath of Freedom paladins
      arose during the Last War, especially in conquered cities such as
      Thaliost, or rebelling nations such as the Eldeen Reaches and
      Darguun.</p><h3 id="tenets-of-freedom">Tenets of Freedom</h3><p><strong>No
      Fear.</strong> The odds are never in one’s favor; the battle is never won
      easily. As long as one fights for what is right, good shall
      prevail.</p><p><strong>No Chains.</strong> Injustice and shackles are the
      tools of the oppressor. All beings deserve to be free, and have control
      over their own fate.</p><p><strong>No Masters.</strong> The thrones of
      tyrants are built on the bones of the innocent. It is not for a people to
      serve their leader - a leader exists to serve their people.</p>
