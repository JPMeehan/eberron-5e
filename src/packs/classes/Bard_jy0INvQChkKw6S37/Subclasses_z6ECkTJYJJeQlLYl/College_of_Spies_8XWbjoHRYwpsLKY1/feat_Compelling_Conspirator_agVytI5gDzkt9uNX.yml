      <p>Beginning at 6th level, your honeyed words are irresistible to
      receptive ears. Any time that you expend a Bardic Inspiration using your
      Suave Spellcasting feature to cast an enchantment spell, you can choose
      one creature that can hear you to have disadvantage on its saving throw
      against that spell.</p>
