    value: >-
      <p>Your words ring true to primal beings. You learn the language
      Primordial. You can communicate in a limited manner with beasts,
      elementals, and plants when you speak Primordial, which magically
      understand the meaning of your words, but have no special ability to
      respond in kind unless they speak at least one language. You have
      advantage on Charisma checks you make to influence them.</p>
