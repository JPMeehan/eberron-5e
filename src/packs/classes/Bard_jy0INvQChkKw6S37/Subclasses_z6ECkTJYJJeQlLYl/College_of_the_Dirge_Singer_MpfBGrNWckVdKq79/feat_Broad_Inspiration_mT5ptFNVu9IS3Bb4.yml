    value: >-
      <p>When you join the College of Dirge Singers at 3rd level, you learn to
      strengthen the hearts of your troops and stir them to greatness. You learn
      the guidance cantrip, which is considered a bard spell for you, but
      doesnâ€™t count against your number of cantrips known. </p><p>Additionally,
      as a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to
      inspire multiple allies. When you do so, choose two creatures within 60
      feet of you that can hear you. Each creature gains one Bardic Inspiration
      die. Your Bardic Inspiration die does not change at 5th level, but remains
      a d6; it becomes a d8 at 10th level, and a d10 at 15th level.</p>
