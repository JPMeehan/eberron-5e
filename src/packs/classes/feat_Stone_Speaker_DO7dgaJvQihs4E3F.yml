  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your pact grants you the ability to commune with earth and stone. As a
      Magic action, you imbue stones in an immobile 30-foot Emanation with
      limited sentience, giving them the ability to communicate with you. You
      can question stones about events in the spell's area within the past day,
      gaining information about creatures that have passed, items that might
      have been removed from the area, and other circumstances. </p><p>If an
      earth Elemental or a creature with the Petrified condition is in the area,
      you can communicate with it as if you shared a language, but you gain no
      magical ability to influence it. </p><p>Once you use this feature, you
      canâ€™t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
