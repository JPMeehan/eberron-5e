      <p>You gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player’s
      Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the
      cleric spell list.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You learn the
      guidance cantrip and two cantrips of your choice from the following list:
      <em>dancing lights</em>, <em>friends</em>, <em>message</em>,
      <em>resistance</em>, <em>spare the dying</em>, <em>thaumaturgy</em>,
      <em>true strike</em>, and <em>Traveler’s enigma</em> (in the “Spells of
      the Six” section of this chapter). At 10th level, you learn another
      cantrip of your choice from this list.</p><p><em><strong>Spell
      Slots.</strong></em> The Dark Petitioner Spellcasting table shows how many
      spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher.
      To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level
      or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long
      rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and
      have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure
      wounds using either slot.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and
      Higher.</strong></em> You know three 1st-level cleric spells of your
      choice. The Spells Known column of the Dark Petitioner Spellcasting table
      shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of
      these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For
      instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new
      spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class,
      you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of
      your choice from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level
      for which you have spell slots.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting
      Ability.</strong></em> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric
      spells, since your spells come from your appeasement or veneration of the
      Dark Six. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
      ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving
      throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
      one.</p>
