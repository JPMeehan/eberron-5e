    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, those who have wronged you will never be able to run for
      long. As an action, you can focus your senses on a creature marked by your
      Vendetta. You sense the direction to the creatureâ€™s location, as long as
      that creature is within 1,000 feet of you, and is not protected from
      divination by spells or effects. If the creature is moving, you know the
      direction of its movement. This lasts for one hour, or until you drop
      concentration (as though concentrating on a spell). You can use this
      ability a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded
      down), and regain all expended uses upon completing a long rest</p>
