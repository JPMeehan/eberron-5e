      <p>A lone hunter is weak, but a pack can bring down the mightiest of prey.
      When you use your reaction to grant an ally advantage on an attack against
      a Sacred Quarry, you can choose a different ally within 30 feet of that
      Quarry who can see or hear you. That ally can use their reaction to move
      up to their speed and make a single weapon attack against it with
      advantage, which deals an additional 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.</p>
