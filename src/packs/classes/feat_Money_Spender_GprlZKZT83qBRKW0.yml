      <p>As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of
      your Channel Divinity to gain favor or turn away prying eyes. Choose a
      number of creatures within 30 feet of yourself equal to one plus one more
      for each divine coin you expend when you use this feature. For each
      target, choose either a bribe or a reward.
      </p><p><em><strong>Reward.</strong></em> The target must make a Wisdom
      saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition for 1
      minute or until it takes damage. While it has the Charmed condition, it is
      Friendly to you and other creatures you designate.
      </p><p><em><strong>Bribe.</strong></em> The target must make a Wisdom
      saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Blinded condition for 1
