      <p>When you join the College of Spies at 3rd level, you gain the ability
      to cloak your spellcasting in charming conversation. You can expend one
      use of your Bardic Inspiration when you cast a spell to cast it without
      somatic components. In addition, any vocal component is audible but
      indistinguishable from casual conversation.</p>
