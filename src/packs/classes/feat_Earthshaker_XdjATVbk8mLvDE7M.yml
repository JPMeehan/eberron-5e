    value: >-
      <p>Your walk shakes the very world, and let none stand in your path. While
      you have taken the form of a Huge or larger Beast, if you move at least 15
      feet in a straight line on your turn, you gain advantage on your next
      attack roll. You can gain this benefit multiple times in a turn.
      </p><p>Additionally, you can choose to expend two uses of Wild Shape to
      take the form of any Beast with a Challenge Rating equal to half your
      level or lower.</p>
