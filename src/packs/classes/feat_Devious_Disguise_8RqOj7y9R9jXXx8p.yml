    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your ruse is indiscernible to all but the most
      astute observers. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You have
      advantage on all ability checks made to maintain your disguise as another
      person.</li><li>You gain proficiency with a disguise kit. If you already
      have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one tool of your
      choice.</li><li>You add the spell
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplDisguiseSe]{disguise
      self} to your spells known, but it does not count against your normal
      number of bard spells known. If you already know this spell, you can
      instead add another spell from the bard spell list to your spells known,
      which must be of a level for which you have spell slots. In addition, when
      you cast disguise self using a spell slot of 2nd level, the duration
      increases to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 3rd level or higher,
      the duration increases to 24 hours.</li></ul>
