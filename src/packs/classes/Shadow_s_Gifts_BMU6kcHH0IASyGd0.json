      "value": "<p>When you use your Channel Divinity feature, you can impart some of the Shadow’s most successful lessons and awaken new gifts in those affected. Choose one of the following magical gifts, bestowing that benefit on yourself and each target of your Channel Divinity: </p><p><em><strong>Eyes of the Medusa.</strong></em> For 1 minute, you can use your bonus action to fix your gaze on one creature within 30 feet of you that you can see and that can see your eyes. The target must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the cleric spell save DC of the cleric that granted you this benefit. On a failed save, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 feet until the end of its next turn. </p><p><em><strong>Heart of the Troll.</strong></em> At the start of your next turn, you regain hit points equal to 1d10 plus the Wisdom modifier of the cleric that granted you this benefit. If you take fire or acid damage before the start of your next turn, you don’t regain hit points from this benefit. </p><p><em><strong>Mastery of the Hag.</strong></em> For 1 minute, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. </p><p><em><strong>Voice of the Harpy.</strong></em> You gain advantage on all Charisma checks for 1 minute</p>",
