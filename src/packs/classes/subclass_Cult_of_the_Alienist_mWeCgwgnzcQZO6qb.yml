      <p>They told you to put down the <em>Codex Anathema</em>. They feared that
      you would plumb its depths too greedily, too deep. They were right to fear
      you.</p><p>The infamous <em>Codex Anathema</em> is the single greatest
      source of Alienists in Eberron. Originally written as a book of lore by a
      mad Dhakaani scholar, its dangerous pages have been replicated and passed
      down for millennia. At one point, there were twelve complete copies of the
      Codex Anathema, but the books were lost, destroyed, or broken apart in the
      intervening timeframe. The last scholar to find a complete copy of the
      book was Mordain d'Phiarlan, who mastered its secrets. Any formal arcane
      institution might hold a secret Cult of the Alienist, its adepts of the
      Codex hiding in the wings, seeking to recruit young minds that are easy to
      corrupt and mold into the next generation of Alienists.</p><p>A dwarf of
      the Mror Holds might also have sought—and found—the twisted knowledge of
      Dyrrn the Conqueror in the Realm Below. Beyond that, an Alienist wizard
      might be any scholar that delved too far into the secrets of Xoriat or had
      a chance encounter with the fleshwarping daelkyr. </p>
