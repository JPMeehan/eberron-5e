      <p>Starting at 6th level, you can cast counterspell using a warlock spell
      slot. If you cause a spell to fail using this feature, you may add that
      spell to your list of spells known if the following conditions are met: it
      is a spell of at least 1st level; it is of lower level than your warlock
      spell slot level; and the spell's duration is no longer than 1 hour. You
      may only have one additional spell granted by this feature. If you choose
      to bind a new spell, it replaces the one previously bound.</p>
