      <p>When you succeed on a contested roll using Dark Kinship, the creature
      has disadvantage on its next saving throw, and you have advantage on your
      next attack roll against it. Additionally, it cannot benefit from being
      hidden or invisible towards you for the next 24 hours.</p>
