    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to chain your foes with
      the flames of the Kalok Shash. By presenting your holy symbol, you can
      force each humanoid, fiend or undead of your choice within 15 feet of you
      that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
      DC. Fiends make the saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the
      creature is restrained for one minute. The creature can repeat the saving
      throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.</p>
