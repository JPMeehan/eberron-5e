  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 7th level, you project an aura of holy flame while you are
      not incapacitated that burns those that would harm you and your allies.
      The aura extends 10 foot from you in every direction, but not through
      total cover. Whenever a creature hits you or an ally within the aura with
      a melee attack, you can choose to deal radiant damage to it equal to your
      proficiency bonus. </p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases
      to 30ft.</p>
