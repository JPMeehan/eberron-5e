      <p>Delving into ruins and dungeons lost to time is a common pastime for
      many would-be adventurers. Typically, this is a gamble on one’s life.
      Explorers don’t just gamble on their lives - they go all in, every time.
      Whether through skill, gumption, or divinely-blessed luck, these heroes of
      tavern tales are famed for their derring-do. It’s not just about finding
      treasure; it’s about the thrill and adventure to an almost obsessive
      degree.</p><p> A true Explorer is marked by their luck, their keen sense
      for traps and survival, and their faith in throwing hands at any problem
      that comes their way. In Xen’drik, such individuals share drinks together
      in the taverns of Stormreach, the merchant guilds of Kul Lerek, and the
      halls of Blackgrove Refuge. Professional explorers can also be found in
      the adventuring guilds of Khorvaire, including the Wayfinder Foundation,
      and Clifftop Guild.</p>
