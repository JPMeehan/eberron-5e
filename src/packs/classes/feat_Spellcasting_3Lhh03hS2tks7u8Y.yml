      <p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you augment your
      martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.</p><h5> Cantrips</h5>
      <p>You learn the spare the dying cantrip and can cast it as a bonus
      action. You also learn two other cantrips of your choice from the cleric
      spell list. You learn another cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th
      level.</p><h5> Spell Slots</h5> <p>The Combat Medic Spellcasting table
      shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st
      level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of
      the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
      finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st level spell bless and
      have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast bless
      using either slot.</p><h5> Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h5>
      <p>You know three 1st level cleric spells of your choice. The Spells Known
      column of the Combat Medic Spellcasting table shows when you learn more
      cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a
      level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th
      level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd
      level.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one
      of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the
      cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have
      spell slots.</p><h5> Spellcasting Ability</h5> <p>Wisdom is your
      spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You use your Wisdom whenever
      a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
      Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you
      cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p></p><b>Spell save
      DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
      modifier<p></p><p></p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency
      bonus + your Wisdom modifier<p></p>
