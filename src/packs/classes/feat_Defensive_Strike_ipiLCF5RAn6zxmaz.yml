    value: >-
      <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers to shield your allies from harm,
      even while you attack. Once per turn when you hit with a weapon attack,
      you can choose to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the weaponâ€™s type. One other
      creature you can see, within 5 feet of either you or your target, gains a
      bonus to AC equal to the extra damage dealt by this feature until the end
      of your next turn. At 11th level in this class, the extra damage and AC
      boost both increase to 2d8 instead. You can use this feature a number of
      times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) per long rest.</p>
