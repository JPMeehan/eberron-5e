The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a weapon attack, it takes 1d6 extra damage from the attack and suffers the chosen effect:</p><ul><li>The creature's speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.</li><li>Cause the creature to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your attack roll. If your attack roll is higher, it is disarmed and drops one weapon it is holding.</li><li>Grant yourself advantage on the next weapon attack you make against the creature in the next minute.</li></ul><p>When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d6.</p>",
