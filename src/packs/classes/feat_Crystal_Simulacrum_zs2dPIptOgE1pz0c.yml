      <p>At 15th level, the emotions embedded in your astral construct become so
      potent that it can even cast your spells. As a bonus action, you can
      command your astral construct to use the Simulacrum Casting action. When
      it uses this action, the astral construct expends one of your spell slots,
      casting one of your prepared artificer spells of that level that has a
      casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action and that does not require
      costly material components. When it casts a spell in this manner, it can
      do so without material components. It uses your spellcasting ability as if
      you had cast the spell. Once you command an astral construct to use the
      Simulacrum Casting action, you can't do so again until you finish a short
      or long rest.</p>
