    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you understand the forces which drove the quori to
      Eberron and the magic that the giants wielded against them. You may access
      their combined power to augment your spells, but bridging the gap between
      worlds damages Eberron itself. You shatter the earth, tear the skies, and
      invoke the nightmares of the quori.</p><p>When you cast a spell of 1st
      level or higher, you can use a bonus action to augment the spell with the
      Cataclysm of Dreams. All targets of the spell must succeed on a Dexterity
      saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC or fall prone. If the
      spell deals damage, you can choose for it to deal psychic damage instead
      of its usual damage type.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times
      equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all
      expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
