      <p>Many among the Ghaash’kala swear the simplest oaths - ones known to
      all, but never spoken. The Oath of Wrath is a fire lit within a paladin’s
      heart to stand firm without vanity or hesitation. At its core, it is
      blinding in its simplicity - a vow to protect the innocent from evil like
      a flame against the night.</p><p>Paladins of Wrath are instruments of
      righteous justice. Most never hesitate to throw themselves into battle,
      shrugging off terrible wounds to cut down their foes. Their rage at those
      who would threaten what is precious to them manifests around them as
      radiant angelic fire. Paladins of Wrath might be blessed by the warrior
      angels of Shavarath, fight amongst the Ghaash’kala of the Labyrinth, or
      worship Dol Arrah, the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice.</p><h3>Tenets of
      Wrath</h3><p><strong>The Sword</strong>. You are the blade forged in
      argent flame. No matter the means, no matter the personal cost, it is by
      your hand that evil shall be sundered.</p><p><strong>The Shield</strong>.
      You are the bastion that stands before the world. The unshakable rock on
      which so many lives stand. It is by your hand that good can
      prevail.</p><p><strong>The Sacrifice</strong>. You are the martyr honored
      by the heavens. Do not fear your passing, nor the coming night - for there
      is naught but beauty in the embers of the dying light</p>
