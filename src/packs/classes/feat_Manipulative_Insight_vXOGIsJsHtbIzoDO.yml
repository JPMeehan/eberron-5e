    value: >-
      <p>You can target one creature you can see as an action and attempt to
      read, and possibly influence, their ambitions, desires, or fears. The
      target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. A
      creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower, or that doesn’t understand
      any language, automatically succeeds on the saving throw. On a failed
      save, you can read the target’s surface thoughts as long as you
      concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell), for up to 1
      hour.</p><p>You also gain a vague sense of the creature’s deepest desires
      or fears. Once while you concentrate, you can pull on the target’s
      emotions as a bonus action to make the target either charmed or frightened
      for as long as you concentrate. If the charmed or frightened creature
      takes damage, it can begin repeating the saving throw at the end of each
      of its subsequent turns, ending this effect on a success.</p><p>You can
      use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and
      you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
