      <p>At 7th level, the holy fire in your veins burns away illness and
      corruption. You are immune to disease, and have advantage on saving throws
      made to resist being poisoned or frightened. When you restore hit points
      to a poisoned or frightened creature, they can immediately make a saving
      throw to end the effect.</p>
