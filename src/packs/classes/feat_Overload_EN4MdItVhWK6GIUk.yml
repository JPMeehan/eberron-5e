    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 14th level, your elemental power overflows from your very
      being. When you cast a spell that deals damage of your elemental affinity
      type, you create a number of elemental motes equal to your Charisma
      modifier that circle your body for 1 minute or until you cause them to
      explode. You can use a bonus action to move a mote up 40 feet and cause it
      to explode, dealing 4d6 points of damage of your elemental affinity type
      to all creatures within 5 feet of the mote.</p><p>Once you use this
      feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p><ul><li>You have a +2 bonus on your spell attack rolls, and your
      spell save DC increases by 2.</li><li>You gain temporary hit points equal
      to your Warlock level, which disappear after a short or long
      rest.</li><li>If you successfully Wild Surge again during this time, you
      cast the spell as if the spell slot was 2 levels higher.</li></ul><p>Once
      you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
      short or long rest.</p>
