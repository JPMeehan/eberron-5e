      <p>Empaths are mentors, therapists, and spiritual guides who realize their
      psionic potential through intuition and emotion. The nature of reality is
      often debated, and the empath uses this very debate as evidence of their
      own philosophy: Belief shapes reality. One does not see an object, one
      only sees a reflection of light bouncing off an object and believes it to
      still be there. Likewise, one can never really know another person, only
      believe in them or not. Belief is the cornerstone of all existence, and if
      one believes in something strongly enough, it becomes reality. Thus, the
      empath channels their belief into psionic power.</p><h3>Guided
      Meditation</h3><p>Empaths use their psionic abilities to aid and protect
      their allies and friends. Their transcendental understanding of the mind
      and its place in the cosmos grants them the ability to influence emotions,
      heal wounds, impart knowledge, and even reshape reality. An empath might
      recite confusing koans or pepper their speech with vague, esoteric terms
      that their companions don’t fully understand, but their usefulness cannot
      be denied.</p><h3>One with the Multiverse</h3><p>An empath understands the
      cosmos and their place in it in terms of feelings rather than facts.
      Though psionic power stems from the mind, the empath channels this power
      through their heart. Logic and deduction, while important, reveal less
      truth to an empath than how they feel about a topic. To an empath, one can
      be technically correct, but still lose an argument because of how it was
      argued. Thus, the empath seeks to resolve conflicts by appealing to
      emotions rather than cold, rational logic, either by using words or their
      psionic abilities.</p><h3>Creating an Empath</h3><p>When creating an
      empath consider your personal philosophy. Is all the world a dream? Is
      every living thing connected, part of a greater whole? Where did you learn
      this philosophy, or did you develop it on your own? Did your psionic
      powers come before your philosophical outlook, driving you to find the
      answers to life’s questions in order to explain your psionic potential? Or
      were your mental abilities the product of meditating on your understanding
      of the cosmos and attaining enlightenment?</p>
