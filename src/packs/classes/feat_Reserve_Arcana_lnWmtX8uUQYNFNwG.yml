      <p>Starting at 6th level, the Dragon Between grants you the ability to
      store a portion of your power to use at a later date. Whenever you expend
      a warlock spell slot, you gain two points of "reserve arcana", up to a
      maximum number of points equal to your Charisma modifier. When you make an
      attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you may spend one point of
      reserve arcana to add 1d6 to that roll. When you make a damage roll, you
      may also spend any number of reserve arcana points up to a maximum of your
      Charisma modifier. Each point spent in this way adds 1d10 force damage to
      the roll. If the damage roll would affect multiple targets, choose only
      one to take the extra damage. You must decide to spend your reserve arcana
      before you roll the attack roll, ability check or damage roll.</p><p> You
      lose all accumulated points of reserve arcana when you finish a short rest
      or a long rest</p>
