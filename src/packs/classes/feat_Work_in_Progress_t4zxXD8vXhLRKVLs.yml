      <p>Starting at 9th level, you can ready half-formed projects for easy
      completion when needed. As an action, you can replace any prepared
      artificer spell with any other spell from the artificer spell list, which
      then counts as a prepared spell for you. </p><p>Once you use this feature,
      you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or a long rest</p>
