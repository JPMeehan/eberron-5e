    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, your bond with the spirits strengthen, and you can
      channel more of your inhabiting spirit's abilities. When you use your
      Spirit Channel feature to select a spirit type, you also gain the
      following benefits for that type:</p><h5> Eldritch Spirit</h5> <p>You
      learn deeper secrets of arcana from your spirit, enabling you to fight
      spellcasters on their own turf. You gain the ability to cast dispel magic
      and counterspell if you expend 3 ki points. In addition, the target of the
      spells takes an amount of force damage equal to twice the level of the
      spell countered or dispelled.</p><h5> Spirit of Conflict</h5> <p>After you
      hit a creature with a melee attack, you can immediately spend 2 ki points
      to invigorate yourself as you prove yourself over the inferiority of your
      foe. You get a bonus 1d4 to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.
      Your opponent must succeed on a Charisma save or take a 1d4 penalty to
      attack rolls and saving throws. Both of these effects last for 1
      minute.</p><h5> Spirit of Eloquence</h5> <p>You can cast dominate person
      on a humanoid within 5 feet if you expend 5 ki points. It has disadvantage
      on this save if it is charmed by you.</p><h5> Spirit of Subtlety</h5>
      <p>You can cast nondetection on yourself without expending a spell slot or
      expensive material components at will. In addition, you can spend 5 ki
      points to cast modify memory, though the only modification that you can
      make is to remove an event in which you were involved.</p><h5> Stalwart
      Spirit</h5> <p>When you use your reaction to reduce damage using your
      Deflect Missiles or Spiritual Channel, you can immediately spend 3 ki
      points to grant yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to your
      Wisdom modifier + your monk level. Any damage that would have reduced your
      hit points instead is applied as a reduction of your temporary hit points.
      These temporary hit points last until you take a short or long rest.</p>
