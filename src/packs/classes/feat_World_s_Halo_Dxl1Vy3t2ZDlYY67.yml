    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to wield the light cast by
      the Ring of Siberys, which can be used to reveal truths. You can cast the
      cantrip light. As an action, you can enhance the effect of an active light
      spell. Creatures within the spell's area of bright light gain advantage on
      the first Wisdom check and the first Wisdom saving throw they make while
      illuminated by the enhanced light spell. When you enhance a light spell
      with this feature, you must complete a short rest before you can do so
      again.</p>
