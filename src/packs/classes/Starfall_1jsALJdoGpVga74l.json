      "value": "<p>Starting at 14th level, the Dragon Above may bestow upon you a rare gift. As an action, you can call a Siberys dragonshard to fall from the sky and strike the ground within 120 feet of you. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw, with DC equal to your warlock spell save DC. An affected creature takes 8d6 radiant damage and 8d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. The bludgeoning damage is considered to be magical. After the impact, the ground within the affected area costs 2 feet of speed for every 1 foot moved.</p><p>At the DM's discretion, using this ability underground or indoors might cause the dragonshard to fall dramatically and violently through the ceiling. Otherwise, the shard manifests spontaneously at the target area before exploding.</p><p>The ability damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. The dragonshard is destroyed on impact.</p><p> When you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
