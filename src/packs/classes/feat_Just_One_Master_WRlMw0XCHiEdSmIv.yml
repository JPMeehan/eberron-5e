  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The fiendish presence in your demonshard has grown, and it reacts badly
      to competition. While your Rage is active you have Advantage on saving
      throws against the Charmed and Frightened conditions, and you have
      Resistance to Psychic damage.</p><p> Additionally, if you take Psychic
      damage or if you make a saving throw to avoid or end the Charmed or
      Frightened conditions, you must use your Reaction, if available, to
      immediately enter a Rage. Entering a Rage in this way does not expend a
      use of your Rage.</p>
