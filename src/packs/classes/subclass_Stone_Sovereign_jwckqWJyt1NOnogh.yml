    value: >-
      <p><em>Hear the Whispering of the Stones</em></p><p>You have listened to
      the will of the stone, and made a pact with one of Eberronâ€™s great earthen
      powers. The whispers of the daelkyr Orlassk corrupt many Warlocks to their
      cause, but similar magics may be the gifts of the greedy fey King
      Grayfinger or even the medusa Queen Sheshka of Cazhaak Draal. The gnomes
      of Lorghalan draw their power from their friendship with the earth
      elementals of their island; perhaps you have made peace with the earth
      itself.</p>
