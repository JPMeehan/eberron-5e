      <p>The school of Oneiromancy was born in the nascent Cul’sir Empire, and
      led to its dominion over the surrounding lands. The giants shaped dreams
      to sustain their kingdom, weaving them into its very foundations. Now, the
      link to the Sea of Dreams is severed, but those who pursue its study can
      still walk the same path. Oneiromancers believe that dreams are
      inspirational and prophetic; their magic removes the barrier between dream
      and consciousness, allowing them to live within surreal worlds of their
      own. The primary mission of many such wizards is to restore their school
      to glory - by repairing the damaged planar link to the wonder found behind
      closed eyes.</p><p> As an Oneiromancy Wizard, you may have stumbled upon
      ancient giant texts, or relics of the Quori, that kickstarted your path
      into lost and ancient magic. Perhaps you see your own dreams as
      inspirational and prophetic, or use them to communicate with the Quori of
      your kalashtar lineage. Or, stranger still, you were a mind long trapped
      in Dal Quor, and found your way out in a fitting mortal host. Either way,
      the dream-scarred lands of Xen’drik are sure to hold the secrets you
      seek…</p>
