      <p>At 3rd level, you learn a unique form of thieves’ cant used by your
      fellow guides to send secret messages. Similarly to the version presented
      in the Rogue class, it takes four times longer to convey an idea in this
      code than to speak it plainly, and you also learn a set of signs and
      symbols to communicate nonverbally. Creatures who know this code can’t
      decipher messages in other similar systems, and vice versa.</p>
