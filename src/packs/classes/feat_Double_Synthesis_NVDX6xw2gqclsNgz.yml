    value: >-
      <p>At 17th level, your duality of body and spirit reaches its apex. When
      you use your Spirit Channel ability, you can select two different spirits
      to inhabit you simultaneously instead of one, gaining the benefits of
      each. If you attempt to channel a third spirit, you must select one of the
      previous two to release, losing its benefits.</p>
