      <p>You can attempt to reject reality, and replace it with your own. As an
      action, you assert your will, describing to the DM a revision in reality
      you would like to occur, and roll a d20. If you roll a number equal to or
      lower than your half warlock level, your chosen reality manifests and
      becomes real. The DM chooses the exact nature of how your reality
      manifests; the effect of any spell of up to 7th level is
      appropriate.</p><p>If you manage to manifest your reality, you canâ€™t use
      this feature again for 1d4 days. Otherwise; you can use it again after you
      finish a long rest.</p><p> At 20th level, your attempt to revise reality
      succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>
