    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, the Dragon Between bestows upon you a special
      Eberron dragonshard. As a bonus action, you may place the dragonshard upon
      the ground and expend it to instantly grow a 10 foot tall sapling in its
      place. Whenever any creature within 100 feet of the sapling expends a
      spell slot, the sapling grows 5 feet taller and grants you two points of
      reserve arcana, which may exceed your usual maximum. You may only gain two
      points of reserve arcana per turn. The sapling holds its power for 1 hour,
      and for that duration you can store an unlimited number of reserve arcana
      points. When the sapling's magic dissipates, any points of reserve arcana
      above your usual maximum are lost. The sapling persists as a non-magical
      tree.</p><p> If your pact-given Eberron dragonshard is expended or
      destroyed, you may generate a new one when you finish a long rest.</p>
