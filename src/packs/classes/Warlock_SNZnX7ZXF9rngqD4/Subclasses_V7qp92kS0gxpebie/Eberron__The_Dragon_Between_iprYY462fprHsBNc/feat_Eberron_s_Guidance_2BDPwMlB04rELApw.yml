    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, you hear the voice of Eberron itself. You may
      cast commune with nature without expending a warlock spell slot. When you
      use this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can do so
      again.</p><p> In addition, your bond with Eberron bolsters your resolve
      against the most fearsome creatures of Khyber. You are immune to the
      frightened condition.</p>
