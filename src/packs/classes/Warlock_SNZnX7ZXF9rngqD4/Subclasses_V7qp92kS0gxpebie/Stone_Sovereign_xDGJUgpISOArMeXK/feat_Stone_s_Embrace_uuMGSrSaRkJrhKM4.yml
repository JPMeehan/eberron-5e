    value: >-
      <p>You always have the Meld into Stone spell prepared. When you cast Meld
      into Stone, you can choose up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of
      you to also gain the benefits of the spell. Each creature must be touching
      a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain their body.
      Affected creatures can end the effect on themselves early by using 5 feet
      of movement to leave the stone where they entered it. </p><p>Creatures who
      finish a Short or Long Rest while under the effect of your Meld into Stone
      spell gain Resistance against the first instance of damage they take after
      leaving the stone.</p>
