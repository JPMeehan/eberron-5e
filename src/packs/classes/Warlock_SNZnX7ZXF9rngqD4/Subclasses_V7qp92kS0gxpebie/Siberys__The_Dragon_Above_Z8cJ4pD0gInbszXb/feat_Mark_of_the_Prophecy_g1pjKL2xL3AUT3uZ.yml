    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, your skill in invoking the predictions of
      Siberys grows. When you expend a weal or woe die to modify a creature's
      roll, you can choose to further augment it, leaving a sprawling dragonmark
      imprinted beneath your feet. If you do, you and all allies within 100 feet
      of the mark (other than the original target of your weal or woe die),
      increase their next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw by the
      value of your expended die. Additionally, all enemies within 100 feet of
      the mark (other than the original target of your weal or woe die), must
      decrease their next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw by the
      same amount.</p><p> When you use this feature, you must finish a long rest
      before you can do so again.</p>
