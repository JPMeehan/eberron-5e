    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, when your plans go awry, you can improve the
      luck of an ally. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a
      spell that you cast on your turn, you can grant a creature of your choice
      within 30 feet of you advantage on their next attack roll, ability check,
      or saving throw they make within the next minute. You can only grant this
      to one creature, regardless of how many creatures succeeded on the saving
      throw. You regain the ability to grant advantage in this way upon
      completing a short or long rest.</p>
