    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can steal the vitality of your enemies with
      your arcane magic. When you hit a creature with a warlock spell attack,
      you regain a number of hit points equal to the damage you deal to that
      creature. If your spell targets multiple creatures, you gain the benefit
      of this feature from only one target of your choice.</p><p> If you use
      this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.</p>
