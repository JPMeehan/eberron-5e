    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, your arcane magic supports and grows the life
      that surrounds you. Whenever you expend a warlock spell slot, you can
      choose one creature within 30 feet of you (including yourself). That
      creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your level (rounded
      down) plus your Charisma modifier. The temporary hit points last until the
      creature finishes a short rest or a long rest.</p>
