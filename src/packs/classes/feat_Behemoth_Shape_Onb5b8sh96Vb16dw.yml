      <p>You gain the power to channel pure primal might, transforming into the
      titans of the wild in battle. You can Wild Shape as a bonus action.
      Additionally, when you Wild Shape into a Beast, you can choose to increase
      the size of your Beast form by one category compared to its normal size.
      When you take the form of a Large or larger Beast, you gain the following
      benefits while transformed:</p><ul><li><strong>Thick Hide</strong>. You
      gain a +2 bonus to your armor class.</li><li><strong>Primal
      Strength</strong>. You gain advantage on Strength ability checks and
      saving throws.</li><li><strong>Powerful Blows</strong>. Your first attack
      that hits on your turn deals an additional 1d4
      damage.</li><li><strong>Predatory Instincts</strong>. If you critically
      hit a creature, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your
      Spell Save DC or become frightened of you. A frightened creature can
      repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the
      effect.</li></ul>
