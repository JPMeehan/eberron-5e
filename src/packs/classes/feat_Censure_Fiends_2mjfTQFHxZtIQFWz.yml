    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to repel
      fiends. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fiend that
      can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw
      against your cleric spell save DC. If the creature fails its saving throw,
      it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p><p>A turned
      creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it
      can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also
      can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or
      try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's
      nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p><p>After you
      reach 5th level you can censure fiends with divine affliction. When a
      creature fails its saving throw against your Censure Fiends feature, it is
      blinded and deafened for 1 minute or until it takes damage, if its
      challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown on the
      Fiendish Affliction table.</p><table><caption>Fiendish
