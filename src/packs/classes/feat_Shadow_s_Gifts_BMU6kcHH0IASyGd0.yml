      <p>When you use your Channel Divinity feature, you can impart some of the
      Shadow’s most successful lessons and awaken new gifts in those affected.
      Choose one of the following magical gifts, bestowing that benefit on
      yourself and each target of your Channel Divinity: </p><p><em><strong>Eyes
      of the Medusa.</strong></em> For 1 minute, you can use your bonus action
      to fix your gaze on one creature within 30 feet of you that you can see
      and that can see your eyes. The target must make a Constitution saving
      throw with a DC equal to the cleric spell save DC of the cleric that
      granted you this benefit. On a failed save, the target’s speed is reduced
      to 0 feet until the end of its next turn. </p><p><em><strong>Heart of the
      Troll.</strong></em> At the start of your next turn, you regain hit points
      equal to 1d10 plus the Wisdom modifier of the cleric that granted you this
      benefit. If you take fire or acid damage before the start of your next
      turn, you don’t regain hit points from this benefit.
      </p><p><em><strong>Mastery of the Hag.</strong></em> For 1 minute, you
      have advantage on saving throws against spells. </p><p><em><strong>Voice
      of the Harpy.</strong></em> You gain advantage on all Charisma checks for
      1 minute</p>
