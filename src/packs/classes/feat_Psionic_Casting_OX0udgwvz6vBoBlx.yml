    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you cast a spell, it requires no verbal or somatic components,
      and it requires no material components, unless they are consumed by the
      spell. However, other creatures can still tell you are casting a spell, as
      your eyes glow, a palpable thrum emanates from you, or some other
      observable display occurs indicating you are casting.</p><p> When you
      reach 3rd level in this class, you can use the Subtle Spell Metamagic
      option when you cast a spell to prevent this observable display from
      occurring</p>
