      <p>The Mourning horrifies and fascinates the people of Khorvaire. Numerous
      studies have been attempted in the short years since the Mourning in hopes
      of studying its effects, discovering its cause, and determining if it's
      reversible... or possible to tame.</p><p>The School of Living Spells makes
      a special study of how magic has gone awry in the Mournland. These
      wizards' expertise is on how the Day of Mourning affected magic cast on
      that day, turning spells into constructs of trapped magical energy. These
      wizards have discovered how to create a living spell of their own, small
      enough to tame, yet holding enormous potential within.</p><p>Lucia
      ir'Brenith, a Cyran refugee living in New Cyre, is the mother of this
      movement, and her lab has become a haven for anyone wishing to study the
      Mournland and living spells in particular. Her research stays
      well-financed by Prince Oargev, who holds out hope that her work can lead
      to something that would explain the Mourning. </p>
