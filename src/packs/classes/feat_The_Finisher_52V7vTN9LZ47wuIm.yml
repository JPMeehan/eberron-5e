    value: >-
      <p>Your legendary exploits have given rise to your trademark finisher -
      the one that everyone knows has taken down countless foes and cemented
      your place in history. When you hit with a melee attack, you can choose to
      make it The Finisher by spending 6 ki points to deal an additional 8d10
      damage. If you are under half your maximum hit points, it instead costs 4
      ki points, and you gain temporary hit points equal to half the additional
      damage rolled.</p>
