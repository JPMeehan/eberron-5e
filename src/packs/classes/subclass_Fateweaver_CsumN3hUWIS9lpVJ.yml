      <p>The many paths of the Draconic Prophecy plot out the course of future
      events. All manner of powerful creatures from the dragons of Argonnessen
      to the fiendish Overlords seek to influence its path, often using mortal
      pawns such as you. You’ve made a pact with a being with insights into the
      future, granting you dark luck and the destiny to succeed. As a
      fateweaver, your powers guide you down a certain path, ensuring your
      success - but don’t push your luck, or you may find yourself cutting the
      strings of your own destiny.</p><p> Examples of beings with the power of a
      Fateweaver include Sphinxes such as Flamewind with their mastery of time,
      the Overlord known as the Spinner of Shadows, and the ancient giants of
      Crux, who may wish to restore their planar citystate to its former
      glory.</p>
