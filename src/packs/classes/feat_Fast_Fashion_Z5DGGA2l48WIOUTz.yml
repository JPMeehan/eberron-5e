      <p>Strutting down runways and quick changes dominate your life. You gain
      proficiency with Disguise Kits. If you already have this tool proficiency,
      take another of your choice. </p><p>You can take a bonus action on each of
      your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Disengage
      action, or to don or doff armor. You can don or doff any armor you are
      proficient in, regardless of the usual time it would take to don or doff
      it. </p><p>Additionally, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
