    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, you can invoke the power of chaos to drive an
      ally to reposition. If you cast a spell with a spell slot of 1st level or
      higher and target an ally with the spell, that ally can use their reaction
      immediately after the spell to move up to their speed without provoking
      attacks of opportunity, or to try to escape a grapple (against the normal
      DC). </p><p>If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally
      who can make the attack</p>
