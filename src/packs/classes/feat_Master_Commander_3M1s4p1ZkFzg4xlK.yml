    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, you unflaggingly maintain the spirits and
      discipline of your unit. During your turn, you can use Countercharm as a
      bonus action. When you start a Countercharm performance, if any creature
      that gains its benefit is currently charmed or frightened, it can
      immediately make another saving throw against the effect that imposed the
      condition.</p><p> In addition, when a creature that gains the benefit of
      your Countercharm performance makes an ability check or saving throw, it
      can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check or saving
      throw.</p>
