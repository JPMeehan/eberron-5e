      <p>The survival of a military unit largely depends on the unity of its
      members, and the War Weaver excels at ensuring this cooperation and
      cohesiveness. Creating a magical tapestry to blanket their close allies,
      the War Weaver can support from afar, pick others up if they fall, and
      punish those who dare attack their unit.</p><p>This art finds its recent
      origins in Aundairian spellcraft before the Last War. It was incorporated
      into Cyre's elite legions and Breland's Dark Lanterns, then spread over
      all of the Five Nations before the war began. Cyran and Aundairian
      artificers have the greatest natural inclination for the
      craft.</p><p>Though Aundair proudly claims the War Weaver tradition as
      their own creation, it predates even the arrival of humanity on the shores
      of Khorvaire. The oral traditions of Talenta halflings recount rare and
      powerful War Weavers through the ages, though their druidic traditions are
      far stronger. And earlier still, tens of thousands of years ago, elven War
      Weavers perfected the art during their exodus from Xen'drik.</p>
