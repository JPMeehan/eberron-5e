    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, you learn to imbue a weapon with a fraction of your
      spirit. The Dhakaani daashors called this weapon the
      <em>ghaal’shaarat</em>, Goblin for “mighty blade.” Imbuing your
      ghaal’shaarat works like infusing an item, but does not count toward your
      maximum number of infused items. When you finish a long rest, you can
      touch a magic or nonmagical simple or martial melee weapon, which becomes
      your ghaal’shaarat.</p><p>Once imbued, your ghaal’shaarat is a magic
      weapon that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, unless the base
      weapon you imbued already grants a higher bonus. This bonus increases when
      you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to +2 at 8th level and
      +3 at 13th level. If the weapon you imbued has the thrown property, it
      returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.
      </p><p>Your ghaal’shaarat’s benefits remain until the weapon is destroyed
      or until you use this ability to imbue a new item with this power. Other
      creatures can’t benefit from your ghaal’shaarat’s powers, and to them, it
      functions as the unimbued weapon did.</p>
