    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to open the minds of others against
      their will and show them the beauty of true understanding. As a bonus
      action, you can force open the mind of a creature within 30 feet, causing
      them to make a Wisdom saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a
      failed save, it is frightened of you for 1 minute or until your
      concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). While the
      effect is active, on each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to
      attempt to frighten an additional creature in the same way; the effect
      ends on any additional creatures at the same time as it does on the first
      creature you frightened. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
      until you finish a long rest.</p>
