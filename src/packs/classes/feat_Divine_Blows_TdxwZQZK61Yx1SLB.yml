    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, you can channel your gifts to smite foes with radiant
      strength. Once per turn when you hit with any weapon attack, you can
      expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target in addition to
      the weaponâ€™s damage. The extra damage is 2d6 for a 1st-level spell slot,
      plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than the 1st, to a maximum of 6d6.
      The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is an undead or fiend, to a
      maximum of 7d6.</p>
