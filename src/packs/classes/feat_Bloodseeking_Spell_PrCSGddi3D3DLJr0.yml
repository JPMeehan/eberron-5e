      <p>At 1st level, your blood powers spells more potent than those of other
      spellcasters. When you cast a spell of 1st or 2nd level, you can choose to
      deal 1d6 points of damage to yourself to either gain advantage on all
      attack rolls of that spell or impose disadvantage on saving throws for on
      all targets of the spell. Damage done to yourself with this feature can't
      be prevented or reduced in any way, and doesn't cause a Constitution save
      to maintain concentration on a spell.</p><p>When you reach certain levels
      in this class, you can increase the damage that you deal to yourself in
      order to intensify higher level spells. If you take 2d6 points of damage,
      you can affect spells of 3rd, 4th, or 5th level. If you take 3d6 points of
      damage, you can affect spells of 6th or 7th level. If you take 4d6 points
      of damage, you can affect spells of 8th or 9th level.</p>
