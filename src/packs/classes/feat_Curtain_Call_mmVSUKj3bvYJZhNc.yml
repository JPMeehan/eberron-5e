    value: >-
      <p>At 17th level, you are vengeance incarnate. When you hit a creature
      marked by your Vendetta with an attack that will deal Sneak Attack damage,
      you can choose for them to have vulnerability to the attack. You can use
      this feature once, and regain the ability upon completing a long rest.</p>
