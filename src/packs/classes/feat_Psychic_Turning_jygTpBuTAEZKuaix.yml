    value: >-
      <p>You can enter a battle of wills and attempt to expel spiritual and
      mental parasites. As an action, you can send out a subtle psychic
      shockwave only perceptible to possessing creatures. Each creature
      currently possessing another creature within 30 feet of you must make a
      Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. A quori must make this
      saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the creature is turned
      for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p><p>A creature turned by this
      effect must use its reaction to immediately leave the creature it has
      possessed, or as a bonus action on its next turn if it has already used
      its reaction, appearing within reach of its former host. A creature that
      would normally return to a different plane of existence when expelled from
      its host instead manifests on your plane of existence, and is not returned
      to its plane when this effectâ€™s duration is over. </p><p>For the duration,
      a turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you
      as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.
      It also can't take reactions after leaving its host. For its action, it
      can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents
      it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
      action. If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion,
      shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is
      turned.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
      Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long
      rest</p>
