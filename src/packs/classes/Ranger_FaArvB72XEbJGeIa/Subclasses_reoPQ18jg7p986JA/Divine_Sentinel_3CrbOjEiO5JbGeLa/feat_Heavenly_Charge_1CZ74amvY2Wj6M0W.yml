      <p>At 15th level, your prowess is rewarded with a companion steed to carry
      you in battle. You learn the spell find greater steed, which does not
      count against your total spells known, and counts as a ranger spell for
      you. You can also cast it once without using a spell slot, and regain the
      ability to do so when you finish a long rest.</p><p> Your steed benefits
      from your Favored Enemy/Foe feature, and also deals the extra damage of
      hunterâ€™s mark when hitting an affected creature.</p>
