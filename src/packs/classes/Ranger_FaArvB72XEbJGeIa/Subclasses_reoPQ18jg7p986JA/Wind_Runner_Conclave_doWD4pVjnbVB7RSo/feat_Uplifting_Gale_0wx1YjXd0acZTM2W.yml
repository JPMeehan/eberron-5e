      you move or fall at least 10 feet in a straight line on your turn, you
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Wind Slash.</strong> Your
      next weapon attack this turn deals an additional 1d8 force damage on a
      hit.</li><li><strong>Slipstream.</strong> Opportunity attacks made against
      you this turn have disadvantage.</li><li><strong>Gale Stride.</strong> You
      can choose to gain a flying speed equal to your normal speed until the

      finishing a long rest.</li></ul>
