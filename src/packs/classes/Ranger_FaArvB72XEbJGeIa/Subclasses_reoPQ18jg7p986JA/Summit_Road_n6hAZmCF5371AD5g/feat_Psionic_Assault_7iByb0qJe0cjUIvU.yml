  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, you have learned to channel the same psychic power
      you’ve trained to defend against. Before making a weapon attack, you can
      change all the damage dealt by the attack to psychic or force damage. If
      you do, this damage ignores the target’s resistances, and treats immunity
      as resistance. When changing the damage type in this way, your reach or
      range becomes 10 feet longer than normal, as you psionically manipulate
      your weapon</p>
