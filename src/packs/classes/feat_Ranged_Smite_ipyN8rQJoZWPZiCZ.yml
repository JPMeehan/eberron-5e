    value: >-
      <p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one
      spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the
      weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus
      1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage
      increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of
      6d8.</p><p> Additionally, your ranged weapon attacks are treated as melee
      weapon attacks for the purposes of Paladin spells you cast, such as
      searing smite or thunderous smite.</p>
