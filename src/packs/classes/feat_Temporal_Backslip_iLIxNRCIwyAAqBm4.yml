      <p>At 17th level, time is a mere matter of perspective for you. As a
      reaction to failing a saving throw or taking damage, you can expend 5 ki
      points to step a split second back in time. Until the end of your next
      turn, you become immune to all damage (including any triggering damage),
      you automatically succeed on all saving throws, and if this reaction was
      triggered by a failed saving throw, you change it to a success.</p>
