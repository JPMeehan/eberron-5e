    value: >-
      <p>When you take a short or long rest outside of a man-made construction,
      you can set down roots and enhance the plant life in the area. After 30
      minutes of resting, you can choose to imbue the land in a 30 foot radius
      around you with two of the following effects:</p><ul><li>You induce rapid
      growth in the land, causing the region to become difficult terrain for all
      creatures except the allies you rest with, as new life blooms.</li><li>You
      focus on establishing a magic link with the existing plant life, allowing
      you to communicate with the plants as if you shared a common language. You
      can question the plants about events in the spellâ€™s area within the past
      day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and
      other circumstances.</li><li>One healing goodberry grows for each hour you
      spend resting. A berry can be eaten or fed to another creature as an
      action to restore 1 hit point, and provides enough nourishment to sustain
      a creature for one day. The berries last until you begin your next long
      rest.</li></ul><p>These effects last until you leave the affected area,
      and are blocked by total cover.</p>
