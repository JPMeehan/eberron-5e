      <p>At 17th level, you can use your action to create a corona of purifying
      light that protects you, often appearing as a cloak of silver flame,
      powerful glowing eyes, or a golden radiance. You gain the following
      benefits for 1 minute:</p><ul><li>+2 bonus to AC.</li><li>Advantage on all
      saving throws.</li><li>Resistance to damage from spells and magical
      abilities of fiends and undead.</li><li>Any fiend or undead that attacks
      you must make a Constitution saving throw against your cleric spell save
      DC. On a failed save, the creature becomes blinded for the remaining
      duration of this feature. The blinded creature can repeat this saving
      throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
      success.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
      until you finish a long rest.</p>
