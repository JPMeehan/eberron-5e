      <p>Psions are erudite sages that master their psionic potential through
      study. Knowledge is power to a psion, in the most literal sense possible.
      Oneâ€™s thoughts and will can bend reality if one knows the correct way to
      think. Thus, psions expand their psionic power to control the world around
      them.</p><h3>Eclectic Knowledge</h3><p>Psions often consider themselves to
      be the ultimate psychics, capable of unlocking almost all forms of psionic
      ability. They can use these powers to communicate wordlessly across vast
      distances, manifest their thoughts into reality, control the energy and
      matter around them, or travel the planes. This focus on the mind often
      precludes them from paying attention to their bodies, typically leaving
      them less able to endure physical stresses. Thus, psions typically choose
      to travel with more rugged, stalwart allies, so that the weak, material
      vessel of their supreme mind is sufficiently defended.</p><h3>Student of
      the Mind</h3><p>A psion is a scholar at heart and shares much in common
      with wizards. However, where wizards study external forces, psions look
      inward and seek to solve the puzzle that is the sentient mind and the
      pathways to power within it. With knowledge of the right techniques and
      practices, the mind is the most potent weapon in the multiverse, according
      to the psion.</p><h3>Creating a Psion</h3><p>When you create a psion,
      consider how you came to learn of psionic abilities. In the world of
      Eberron, psionic ability typically stems from Xoriat and Dal Quor, two
      planes of existence comprised of the essence of thoughts. Dal Quor is the
      Region of Dreams, where all mortal minds travel when they sleep. Xoriat is
      often known as the Realm of Madness, but some esoteric texts refer to it
      as the Realm of Revelations. In other settings, psionic power is common to
      creatures of the Astral Plane or the Far Realm. When you studied your mind
      and its connection to these planes, which door did you open? Were you
      taught how to realize your psychic potential by a mentor? Or did you
      unlock the secrets of your mind through strict discipline, intense
      self-reflection, and personal study?</p>
