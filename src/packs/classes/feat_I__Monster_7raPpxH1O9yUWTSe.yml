    value: >-
      <p>You have ascended to the pinnacle - a prime hunter undefeated by the
      horrors of the world. When you Action Surge or use Second Wind, you gain
      advantage on all of your attacks until the end of your turn. Additionally,
      when you make a Strength (Athletics) or Charisma (Intimidation) check, you
      can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>
