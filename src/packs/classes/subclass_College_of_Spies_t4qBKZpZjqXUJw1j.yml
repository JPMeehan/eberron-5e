      <p>Eberron is a world ravaged by recent conflict, and an uneasy peace
      holds over the land in a cold war. No one knows who or what caused the
      Mourning, so no country is willing to risk making the first move... at
      least not overtly. Thus, bards of the College of Spies have honed the art
      of diplomacy and cunning, and were invaluable during the Last War as
      secret agents and information gatherers.</p><p>The Dark Lanterns of
      Galifar were the first to hone the bard's social graces to a keen dagger.
      By the time the Last War broke out, espionage was a widespread tradition
      across the Five Nations. The Dark Lanterns of Breland have traditionally
      maintained the highest numbers of this college, but the Royal Eyes of
      Aundair and the remains of the Fifth Crown of Cyre are just as proactive
      in recruitment as their Brelish counterparts. Houses Phiarlan and Thuranni
      also have strong traditions of Spy bards.</p><p>Unknown to Khorvaire, the
      Thousand Eyes of Riedra have also perfected a variant of this college that
      uses psionic, not arcane magic. These agents have likely infiltrated the
      governments of the Five Nations and beyond. </p>
