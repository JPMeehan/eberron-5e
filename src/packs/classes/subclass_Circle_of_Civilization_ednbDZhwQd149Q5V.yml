      <p>The origins of the Circle of Civilization are a mystery. No one can
      pinpoint the very first adept, but their power is undeniable. After all,
      humanoids are a part of nature as much as the bird or the fish, and they
      share much in common with insects. Changing their environment to suit
      their needs, swarming in droves to settle new lands, and grouping together
      in large colonies that they call 'cities.'</p><p>While rare, these druids
      are found all over Khorvaire, joined together in a loose sect known as the
      Community. Druids of the Circle of Civilization rarely appear in Aerenal
      and Sarlona, mostly due to the persecution that they face in Riedra and
      the elves' affinity for necromancy.</p><p>The only continent that they do
      not appear on is Xen'drik; despite the growing city of Stormreach, no
      native of that continent has ever been recorded as hearing this calling.
