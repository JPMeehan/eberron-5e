      "value": "<p>Monks of the Way of the Conduit learn to listen to spirits and ghosts in the world around them, giving each a voice in exchange for augmenting the monk's own abilities. Followers of this path teach that true enlightenment cannot be found by one's self, but rather, wisdom must come from the spirits of those around you. After all, those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</p><p>The most common practitioners of this Way are kalashtar mystics channeling the former hosts of their line, as well as Karrnathi monks who bind heroic spirits to help them in battle. A more unusual tradition exists among the orcs and shifters of the Eldeen Reaches and Shadow Marches, who communicate with spirits of nature and bargain with them for aid. Certain halfling adepts of the Talenta Plains also communicate with nature spirits as well. </p>",
