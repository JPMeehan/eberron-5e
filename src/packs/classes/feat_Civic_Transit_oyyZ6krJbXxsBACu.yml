    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, if you live in a city for at least a month,
      you can claim it as part of your territory, up to a number of cities equal
      to your proficiency bonus. You can designate a new claimed city if you
      stay within its borders for at least a month, and you can choose which
      city to remove from your territory if claiming a new one would exceed your
      maximum.</p><p>When you finish a long rest in a claimed city, you can
      spend 10 minutes concentrating on thoughts of another city you have
      claimed on the same plane of existence as you, then teleport yourself to a
      public location of your choice in that city. When you do so, you can
      expend one spell slot to simultaneously transport other willing creatures
      with you; for every level of the spell slot you expend, you can transport
      one additional creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of
      you. Every creature teleported in this manner appears in the nearest
      unoccupied square to you.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use
      it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
