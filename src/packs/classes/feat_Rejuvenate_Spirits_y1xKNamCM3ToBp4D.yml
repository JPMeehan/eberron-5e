    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, you rally your allies to fight longer than they thought
      possible. If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus
      action to choose one willing creature within 60 feet of you that can hear
      you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to spend one Hit Die
      and heal itself by rolling the die, adding its Constitution modifier and
      your Charisma modifier, and regaining a number of hit points equal to the
      total (minimum of 1).</p><p>Starting at 7th level, when you target a
      creature with this feature, it can also move up to half of its speed
      without provoking opportunity attacks.</p><p>When you reach certain levels
      in this class, the maximum number of Hit Dice creatures can spend when
      targeted with this feature increases by 1, increasing at 7th level (2 Hit
      Dice), 10th level (3 Hit Dice), 15th level (4 Hit Dice), and 18th level (5
      Hit Dice).</p>
