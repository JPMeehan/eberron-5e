    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, you have learnt to embody the unbreakable faith of the
      Kalok Shash. You cannot be moved against your will by other creatures,
      except by effects that would teleport you or create an object or
      impassable barrier in your space.</p><p>When you have expended the last
      spell slot you have remaining, for up to 1 minute afterward you have
      advantage on all Strength saving throws and checks, and on melee weapon
      attacks. Once you gain this benefit you must finish a long rest before you
      can do so again.</p>
