    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, you excel at inspiring and directing soldiers in
      battle. When a creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you takes
      the Attack action on its turn, you can use your reaction to allow it an
      additional weapon attack. The creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die,
      adding the number rolled to its weapon damage roll.</p>
