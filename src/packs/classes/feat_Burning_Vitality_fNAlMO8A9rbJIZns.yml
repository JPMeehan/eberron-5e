      <p>Your experience grants you masterful control over your flames. While
      you are raging, you gain immunity to fire and cold damage, and ignore the
      fire resistance of creatures that you damage. Additionally, your Heart of
      Flame abilities improve in the following ways:</p><p><strong>Boiling
      Blood</strong>. You seethe with fury, internalizing the fire that burns in
      your veins. Whenever you begin your turn grappled by a creature, or a
      creature begins its turn grappled by you, you can choose for it to take
      fire damage equal to 2d6 + your proficiency bonus. Additionally, whenever
      a creature hits you with an attack while within 15 feet of you, they take
      fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</p><p><strong>Blazing
      Blows</strong>. You focus your rage outwards, causing your weapons to
      ignite. When you make a melee attack for the first time on your turn,
      every creature of your choice in a 15ft cone originating from you in the
      direction of your attack takes fire damage equal to twice your proficiency
      bonus.</p>
