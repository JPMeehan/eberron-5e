      <p>You can draw on the strength of mountains to endure any pain. On your
      turn, you can spend 5 ki points, requiring no action, to begin
      concentrating (as though concentrating on a spell) for up to 1 minute.
      While you maintain your concentration, your hit points cannot drop below 1
      while you are in contact with the ground. If your concentration is broken
      due to taking damage while you are in contact with the ground, your
      concentration ends but your hit points are not reduced below 1 by that
      damage. You can use this feature once, and you must finish a short or long
      rest before you can do so again</p>
