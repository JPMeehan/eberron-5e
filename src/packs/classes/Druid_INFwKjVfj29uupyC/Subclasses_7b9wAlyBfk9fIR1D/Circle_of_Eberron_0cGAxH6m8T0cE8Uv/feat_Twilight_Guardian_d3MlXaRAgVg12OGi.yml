    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, you feel the pulse of Eberron's heartbeat in your own
      veins, and in moments of oneness, can transform into a dragonlike form of
      greenery and flora. As an action while touching unworked earth, unworked
      stone, or a body of water, you transform into a twilight
      guardian.</p><p>You can stay in this form for a number of hours equal to
      half your druid level (rounded down), then revert to your normal form. You
      can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your
      turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit
      points, or die. While you are transformed into your twilight guardian
      form, you follow the same rules as if you were in your Wild
      Shape.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
