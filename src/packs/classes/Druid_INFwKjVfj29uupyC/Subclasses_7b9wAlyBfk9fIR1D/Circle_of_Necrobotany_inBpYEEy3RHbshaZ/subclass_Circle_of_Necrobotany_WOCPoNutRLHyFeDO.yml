    value: >-
      <p>Druids of the Circle of Necrobotany follow in the footsteps of Lord
      Varonaen of Farlnen, engineering plant life that can grow and thrive under
      the influence of Mabar. They cultivate a bloody garden in a small Mabar
      manifest zone, which grows along with them.</p><p>Bloodsail elves are the
      most likely to be necrobotanists, but they arenâ€™t the only group. The
      Children of Winter have begun to experiment with similar techniques in The
      Gloaming, a large Mabar manifest zone in the Eldeen Reaches.</p>
