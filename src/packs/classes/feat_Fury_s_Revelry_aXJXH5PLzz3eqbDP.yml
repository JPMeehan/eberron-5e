    value: >-
      <p>You have learned to empower your bardic magic to inspire frenzied
      dance. Once on your turn when you hit a creature with a bard spell attack
      or when a creature fails a saving throw against one of your bard spells,
      you can force that creature to dance. That target must immediately move 5
      feet, plus an additional 5 feet for each level of the triggering spell
      (cantrips are level 0), in a direction of your choice. The movement need
      not be in a straight line. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity
      attacks. If a target is compelled to move into an obviously dangerous
      hazard, such as a fire or pit, it can make a Wisdom saving throw against
      your bard spell save DC. On a successful save, its movement ends before it
      enters the hazardous space, and you can move it no further that turn.</p>
