    value: >-
      <p>While a creature is affected by your enhance ability spell, or while
      you control a creature that you summoned, animated, or created with magic,
      that creature becomes an exemplar companion. Your Aura of the Paragon
      extends to the area around each exemplar companion as if you were in that
      creature’s space.</p><p> Additionally, when an exemplar companion gains
      your ancestor’s favor, the extra damage it deals increases by 1d4 for each
      spell level higher than 1st that you expended with your Divine Smite.</p>
