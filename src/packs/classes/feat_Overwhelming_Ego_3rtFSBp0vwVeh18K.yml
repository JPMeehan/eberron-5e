      <p>Your fame and exploits are so great that they spread through the land
      ahead of you. Before speaking to someone for the first time (including
      during combat), you can declare that they have heard of you and your
      accomplishments. The target must share at least one language in common
      with you. This does not necessarily mean they like you (in fact, they may
      now hate you as a result), but they have heard of you. When interacting
      with someone that has heard of you in this way, you can add twice your
      Wisdom modifier to all Charisma ability checks made to interact with them.
      You can declare this once, and regain the ability to do so upon completing
      a long rest.</p><p>Additionally, if you are ever in combat against them,
      their opinion of you clouds their judgment. When you hit them with a melee
      attack, you can spend 1 ki point to give them disadvantage on attack rolls
      against targets other than you until they next hit you with an attack, as
      your infuriating attitude (presumably) drives them up the wall.</p><p>One
      should keep a list of their adoring fansâ€¦just in case</p>
