      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can embody the essence of civilization,
      expending a use of your Wild Shape feature to gain other benefits rather
      than transforming into a beast form. As an action, you can expend a use of
      your Wild Shape feature to cast the disguise self spell.</p><p>Starting at
      4th level, as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature
      to touch another creature and grant it advantage on all ability checks
      made in the next minute with one ability that you choose when you use this
      feature. At 8th level, as a bonus action, you can expend a use of your
      Wild Shape feature to grant yourself and all the equipment you carry the
      ability to effortlessly move through nonmagical earth and stone. While
      doing so, you don't disturb the material you move through and you leave no
      traces of your passage. This effect lasts until the beginning of your next
      turn.</p>
