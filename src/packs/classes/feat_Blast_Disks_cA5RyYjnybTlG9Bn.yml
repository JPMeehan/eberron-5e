    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can
      magically imbue effects to create a blast disk from a flat stone you
      touch.</p><p>You can create one blast disk at the end of a long rest,
      imbuing it with one effect from the Blast Disks table, which you can later
      trigger by detonating the disk.</p><p>Creating a blast disk requires that
      you have mason's tools on your person, and any disk that you imbue with
      this feature lasts until it detonates or the end of your next long rest,
      when the magic dissipates.</p><p>When you reach certain levels in this
      class, you can imbue additional disks at the end of a long rest: two at
      5th level, three at 9th level, and four at 15th level. Each disk requires
      its own flat stone.</p><p>You can imbue additional blast disks by
      expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do
      so, you use your action to touch a stone disk and create a blast disk
      imbued with one effect from the Blast Disks table.</p><p>When a blast disk
      detonates, every creature within a 5-foot radius must make a saving throw
      as indicated on the Blast Disks table. On a failed save, a creature takes
      damage and is subject to the blast disk's effects. On a successful save,
      the creature takes half damage and suffers no other effect. The saving
      throw DC to avoid a blast disk's effects is equal to your artificer spell
      save DC.</p><h5> Detonating a Blast Disk</h5> <p>As an action, you can
      touch an imbued blast disk to activate it, choosing whether to detonate it
      on impact or by proximity when you do so. Once activated, the blast disk
      can be detonated any time before the end of your next long rest using the
      detonation type you chose when you activated it:</p><ul><li><b>Impact
      Detonation</b>. You can use your action to throw an activated blast disk
      up to 15 feet, where it detonates on contact with a creature or object,
      triggering its effect.</li><li><b>Proximity Detonation</b>. You place an
      activated blast disk on the ground, then when any creature other than you
      approaches within 5 feet of the activated blast disk, it immediately
      detonates, automatically triggering its
      effect.</li></ul><table><caption>Blast Disks</caption><thead><tr><th
