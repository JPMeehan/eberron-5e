      <p>Some rangers bear a connection to the primal spirits of the wind, using
      their gifts to soar through the air and strike with zephyr speed. Their
      grace is breathtaking, but a Wind Runner is as elusive as they are
      dangerous. Many are carefree spirits who see beauty in freedom; others
      serve as natural protectors of aeries and high peaks, communing with the
      flying beasts that they see as kin.</p><p> In Eberron, Wind Runners are
      often found in the Zephyr Guard of the flying city of Kul Lerek, and among
      the halfelves of the Mark of Storm. Both House Lyrandar and the piratical
      Wind Whisperers train the dragonmarked to harness such skills, especially
      those who aspire to fly an airship. During the Last War, several nations
      also fielded aerial infantry as part of their forces, including the flying
      Angels of Thrane. A Wind Runner might also be touched by the planes of
      Syrania or Lamannia, or be descended from the cloud giants of Xen’drik. In
      Sarlona, Wind Runners can be found in the high mountains of Adar, and
      often form bonds with the nation’s flying asperi steeds.</p>
