      <p>Stone is no prison to you. Whenever you have the Petrified condition,
      you are aware of your surroundings and you have Immunity to Bludgeoning,
      Piercing, and Slashing damage.</p><p>Additionally, you have learned to
      take on a stone form to protect yourself from injury. As a Reaction when
      you take damage, you can give yourself the Petrified condition until the
      start of your next turn. The Petrified condition applies before you take
      the triggering damage, possibly granting Resistance or Immunity to that
      damage. When the Petrified condition ends, you can choose to emerge from a
      stone surface into an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of
      yourself.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until
      you finish a Short or Long Rest.</p>
