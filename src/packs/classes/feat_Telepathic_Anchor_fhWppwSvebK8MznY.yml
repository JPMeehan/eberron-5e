    value: >-
      <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can speak
      telepathically to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You
      don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your
      telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at
      least one language.</p><p>When you're using this trait to speak
      telepathically to a creature, you can use your action to give that
      creature the ability to speak telepathically with you for 1 hour or until
      you end this effect as an action. To use this ability, the creature must
      be able to see you and must be within 30 feet of you. You can give this
      ability to only one creature at a time; giving it to a creature takes it
      away from another creature who has it.</p><p>If you can already
      communicate telepathically, this feature extends the range of your
      telepathy by 30 feet, in addition to the above benefits.</p>
