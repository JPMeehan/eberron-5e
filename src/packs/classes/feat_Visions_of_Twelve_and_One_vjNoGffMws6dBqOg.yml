    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, your observations of the Dragon Above grant you
      an understanding of the way the events of the world will unfold. When you
      finish a short rest or a long rest, roll two d6s and record the numbers
      rolled. After you roll, choose one as your "weal die" and one as your "woe
      die". As a reaction when a creature within 60 feet of you (including you)
      makes an attack roll, ability check or saving throw, you can add your
      "weal die" to the roll or subtract your "woe die" from the roll. You may
      choose whether to expend a weal or woe die when you know whether the
      unmodified roll would succeed or fail, but before any effects (such as
      damage) are applied.</p><p> Each weal or woe die can be used only once.
      When you finish a short rest or a long rest, you must replace your weal
      and woe dice.</p>
