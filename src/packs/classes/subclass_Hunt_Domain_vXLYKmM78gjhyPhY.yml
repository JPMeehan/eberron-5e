      <p>Since the dawn of history, mortalkind has prayed to the gods for
      bountiful hunts. Taking down prey means survival; failure means becoming
      prey in turn. Clerics of the Hunt domain take up this ancient duty,
      ensuring that luck is on their allies' side, while joining the battle with
      bow and spear. To them, their prey are part of the cycle of life, and sent
      as divine gifts that should never be squandered.</p><p> Hunt domain
      clerics seek to protect the course of nature, often by hunting monsters
      that would threaten communities or upset the local balance. Many fiercely
      oppose poachers. The concept of hunting creatures for sport without making
      use of their sacrifice, or respecting their strength, is anathema to their
      beliefs. In Eberron, Hunt doman clerics can be found worshiping the god
      Balinor in Khorvaire, especially in the Eldeen Reaches and Lhazaar
      Principalities. In Xenâ€™drik, the Vulkoori and Qaltiar drow worship the
      aspect of Vulkoor known as the Hunter, while goliaths descended from the
      Esht Primacy often venerate Banor the Bloody Spear.</p>
