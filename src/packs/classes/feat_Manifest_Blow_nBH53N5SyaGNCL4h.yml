    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, choose one of the following damage types when
      you finish a long rest: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, cold, lightning,
      necrotic, psychic, or thunder. On your turn, the first creature you hit
      with an unarmed strike takes an additional 1d6 points of damage of that
      type. If you select bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it benefits
      from your Ki-Empowered Strikes class feature and counts as magical damage.
      </p><p>Nightmare Shroud monks typically inflict psychic damage with this
      ability, Forged Heart monks enhance their bludgeoning damage, and
      Weretouched grow sharper claws. However, you can choose any damage type,
      regardless of your discipline(s).</p>
