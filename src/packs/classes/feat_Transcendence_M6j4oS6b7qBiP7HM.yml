    value: >-
      <p>You are closer than ever to the Silver Flame, and the gestalt
      consciousness within, and can draw upon its power to transform you in
      battle. As a bonus action on your turn, you can assume the form of a
      transcendent shulassakar for one minute, gaining the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Your creature type becomes celestial.</li><li>Your
      unarmed strikes and telekinetic assault attacks deal additional radiant
      damage equal to one roll of your martial arts die.</li><li>When you damage
      a creature with your Psionic Strike, force ripples out from the strike,
      and you can deal the Psionic Strike damage to one additional target within
      30 feet of you.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t do so
      again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 ki to do so.</p>
