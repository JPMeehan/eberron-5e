      <p>You begin to master the innate magic you have inherited from your links
      to the giants. Choose one of the giant ancestries in the Giant Magic
      table. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this
      class, depending on your chosen ancestry. These spells count as sorcerer
      spells for you, but do not count against the number of sorcerer spells you
      know. These spells canâ€™t be replaced when you gain a level in this
      class.</p>
