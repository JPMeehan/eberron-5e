      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can thread together unseen strands of
      arcane force to connect allies in a magically resonant network know as an
      eldritch tapestry. At the end of a long rest, you can choose a number of
      willing creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier that you can see
      within 30 feet of you. These creatures are woven into your tapestry until
      the end of your next long rest, even if they move more than 30 feet from
      you. You are always considered part of your own tapestry, but you do not
      count against the total number of creatures allowed.</p><p>Additionally,
      when casting a spell with a range of touch on one of the creatures in your
      eldritch tapestry, the range of the spell increases to 10 feet. As you
      gain more levels in this class, the range at which you can cast touch
      spells increases to 20 feet at 5th level, 30 feet at 9th level, and 60
      feet at 15th level. You can also use the Help action on any of your
      tapestry allies if they are within this range.</p><p>As a reaction to
      seeing one of the creatures in your tapestry drop to 0 hit points, you can
      unmake your eldritch tapestry to heal that creature a number of hit points
      equal to your artificer level. When you do so, your entire tapestry is
      unmade, removing all creatures from it.</p><p>You can expend a spell slot
      of 1st level or higher to spend 1 minute reweaving the tapestry as if you
      had just finished a long rest. If you weave a second tapestry while the
      first still exists, the creatures previously in your tapestry are replaced
      by the new creatures you select.</p>
