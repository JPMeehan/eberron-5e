      <p>At 10th level, you can expend two uses of your Wild Shape feature to
      become the personification of elemental chaos. For the normal duration of
      the ability, you can Wild Shape into either an air, earth, fire, or water
      elemental â€” but the uncontrollable nature of your power makes it difficult
      to pin down which. Roll on the Chaotic Form table to determine which kind
      of elemental you turn into. Additionally, your attacks in this form count
      as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
      nonmagical attacks</p>
