    value: >-
      <p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more
      dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape
      to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore
      the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other
      limitations there). </p><p>Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a
      beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3,
      rounded down.</p>
