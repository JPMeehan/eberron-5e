  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Lurks are silent killers that have harnessed the cold logic of their
      inner id to hone their deadly skills. The id, the urge for survival, to
      rationalize away all obstacles to your continued existence, is a primal
      aspect of the psyche buried under moral and ethical layers of the ego and
      superego.</p><p>Not all lurks are amoral, instead some merely use the
      ruthless rationality that lies within everyone. Heroic lurks use this cold
      logic in the pursuit of altruistic goals, and still others practice a
      philosophy of “enlightened self-interest,” recognizing cooperation is more
      likely to result in success than pure sociopathy. But all lurks tap into
      this dark well of their mind to manifest their powers.</p><p>The Dreaming
      Dark employs lurks as merciless scalpels, to execute the plans of their
      quori masters. The Kalashtar shadow watchers, ever fighting their secret
      war against the Dreaming Dark, likewise employ the talents unique to the
      lurk to help their people survive the world of darkness, guiding them
      toward the Great Light ahead. However, the most prevalent lurks in
      Khorvaire are changeling agents of the Cabinet of Faces, tapping into the
      psionic potential hidden in their race to sneak into places unseen and
      pull the strings of history from the shadows.</p>
