    value: >-
      <p>You can feel where the barrier between realities is permeable. As an
      action, you can automatically determine the direction and distance to the
      nearest planar breach. You also identify which plane the breach is tied
      to. A planar breach is any manifest zone, wild zone, reality storm tied to
      a plane of existence, or extraplanar portal (but not a portal to an
      extradimensional space, such as that created by a rope trick spell or an
      open bag of holding).</p><p> You can use this feature a number of times
      equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest</p>
