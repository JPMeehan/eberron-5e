    value: >-
      <p>Your increasingly monstrous visage is awesome to behold. You gain
      proficiency in Charisma (Intimidation) checks; if you are already
      proficient, you instead add twice your proficiency
      bonus.</p><p>Additionally, your experience in battle grants you a greater
      understanding of the foes you face. As a bonus action, you can make an
      Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by a Charisma (Deception) check from
      a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to gauge its fighting
      capabilities. On a success, you can choose to learn one of the following
      pieces of information about them:</p><ul><li>Their damage immunities and
      resistances.</li><li>Which of their ability scores is the
      highest.</li><li>Whether they are above or below half their maximum hit
      points.</li><li>Whether they are intelligent enough to speak or understand
      a language.</li></ul><p>You can attempt to learn about a creature multiple
      times, but if the target succeeds on the contested ability check, you
      cannot use this ability against that individual creature for 24 hours.</p>
