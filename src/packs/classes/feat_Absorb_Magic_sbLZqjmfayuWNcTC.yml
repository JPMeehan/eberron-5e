    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 6th level, you learn how to harness your familiar's hunger
      for magic. When you or your familiar would be targeted by a spell cast by
      a creature within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to intercept
      the spell and try to break it down into raw magic. Make a spellcasting
      ability check with a DC equaling 10 + the spell's level. If your familiar
      is currently imbued with a spell, you gain a + 1d4 bonus on this check. On
      a success, the spell fails and has no effect, and both you and your
      familiar receive temporary hit points equal to three times the level of
      the spell absorbed. On a failure, the spell succeeds.</p><p>Once you use
      this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p>
