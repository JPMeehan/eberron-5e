      <p>At 18th level, you are the bastion that holds the line. When you use
      your Action Surge feature, select a number of creatures equal to half of
      your Charisma modifier (rounded down) within 60 feet of you that can see
      and hear you. They can use their reaction to immediately take an
      additional action as if it were their turn. As part of that action, they
      can't make more than 2 weapon attacks, and any spells cast must be of 5th
      level or lower.</p>
