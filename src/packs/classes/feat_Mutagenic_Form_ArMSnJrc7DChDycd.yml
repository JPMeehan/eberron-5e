    value: >-
      <p>You can augment your body with the power of the horrors you face,
      enhancing your abilities in gruesome fashion. When you and your party
      battle against and kill a creature with a type from the following list,
      you can spend 1 hour of undisturbed time (which can be performed during a
      short rest) to bind some of its power to you in an occult ritual. The
      exact method by which you do this is up to you, and might involve
      consecrating the weapon used in the name of your religion, implanting part
      of the creatureâ€™s essence within your physical form, or preserving part of
      its body as a trinket on your person. Upon completion, you permanently
      unlock that Mutagen. Additionally, when you choose this archetype, you
      gain access to one Mutagen of your choice.</p><p>When you finish a long
      rest, you can choose to focus on Mutagens you have unlocked, gaining their
      benefits. This lasts until you choose to focus on a different Mutagen,
      switching their effects. You can focus on a number of Mutagens at once
      equal to your proficiency bonus. If a Mutagen requires a saving throw,
      your Mutagenic Form save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Constitution modifier.</p><p>For every two Mutagens that you focus on,
      your first melee attack on your turn that hits deals an additional 1d6
      damage.</p>
