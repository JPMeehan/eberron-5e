      <p>The fiendish presence in your demonshard can punish your enemies. While
      your Rage is active, if you take damage from a creature that you can see
      within 60 feet of yourself, the creature takes 1d4 Fire or Necrotic damage
      (your choice). You can use this feature only once per turn.</p><p>In
      addition, if an allied creature within 10 feet of you takes damage from a
      creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can use your
      Reaction to cause the damaging creature to take 1d4 Fire or Necrotic
      damage (your choice).</p><p> The damage increases when you reach Barbarian
      levels 6 (1d6), 10 (1d8), 14 (1d10) and 20 (1d12).</p>
