      <p>At 7th level, you have uncanny luck in difficult situations. You gain a
      pool of three fortune points that you can use to influence events in your
      favor. A fortune point is expended when you use it, and you regain all of
      your expended fortune points when you finish a short or long rest. At 15th
      level, you gain two additional fortune points.</p><p>You can expend a
      fortune point at any time to gain one of the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>All opportunity attacks against you are made at
      disadvantage until the end of your turn.</li><li>You gain advantage on one
      ability check.</li><li>The last creature that you hit with a weapon attack
      on this turn focuses all its attention on you. It has disadvantage on all
      attack rolls against other creatures until the start of your next
      turn.</li><li>You can fall from great heights and land without a scratch.
      When you take falling damage, you reduce the damage dice rolled by up to
      5d6.</li></ul>
