      <p>Your magic has grown large enough for you to create and access your own
      personal extradimensional space. Your extradimensional space is a
      featureless room 30 feet in each dimension. The walls and floor of this
      room appear as you wish. Your extradimensional space persists forever,
      even should you die. You can access this extradimensional space in two
      ways.</p><p>First, you can pass any object you can lift or carry into the
      extradimensional space as a bonus action. The object disappears from your
      hands and appears where you choose in your extradimensional space. You can
      retrieve items youâ€™ve stowed in your extradimensional space with another
      bonus action, provided you have a hand free. </p><p>The second way you can
      access your extradimensional space is by touching a solid surface at least
      6 feet in diameter and spending 8 sorcery points as an action. When you
      do, a shimmering white portal 6 feet in diameter appears on the surface,
      leading to your extradimensional space. You and creatures of your choice
      you can see when you create the portal can enter it and appear safely in
      your extradimensional space, emerging from a matching portal there. The
      portals last for as long as a creature is present in your extradimensional
      space, or until the start of your next turn if no creatures are present
      there.</p>
