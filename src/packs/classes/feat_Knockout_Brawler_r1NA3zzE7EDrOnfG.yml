    value: >-
      <p>Oneâ€™s fists are the first and greatest weapon they are born with, and
      you are no stranger to good old-fashioned fisticuffs. When a creature hits
      you with an attack, your first unarmed strike or attack with a whip
      against them on your next turn has advantage and deals additional damage
      on a hit equal to a roll of your martial arts die. This increases to two
      rolls of your martial arts die if you are under half your maximum hit
      points, spend 1 ki point when you hit with the attack, or have used
      Uncharted Traversal to add distance to your jump this turn.</p>
