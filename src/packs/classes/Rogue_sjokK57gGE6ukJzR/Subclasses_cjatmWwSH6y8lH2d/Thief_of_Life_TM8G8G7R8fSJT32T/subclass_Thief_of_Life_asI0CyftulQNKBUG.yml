  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The Thieves of Life believe that Divinity Within is something that can
      be taken from others - and they willingly employ all manner of methods to
      steal divine sparks. The Thief of Life rogue has an innate sense for life
      and how to make it theirs, tracking and stealing vitality from their
      targets with ruthless hunger.</p><p>The largest Thief of Life community is
      in the Shadow Marches, under the command of Janilya the Fearless. However,
      there are Thieves of Life scattered across Khorvaire, including the large
      community in Fairhaven led by Torven d’Medani, the half-elf who stole a
      vampire’s undeath for his own. A Thief of Life could be anywhere they find
      the divinity they seek.</p>
