      <p>At 13th level, the targets of your Vendetta will always fear the bite
      of your weapons in their back. When you curse a creature with your
      Vendetta, as part of the reaction, you can choose to teleport to an
      available space within 10 feet of them.</p><p> Additionally, your sneak
      attack damage dice become d10s against targets marked by your
      Vendetta.</p>
