    value: >-
      <p>You excel at producing minor magical effects—and at abandoning your
      current projects to pursue new ideas. Starting at 3rd level you gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You know one additional cantrip beyond
      what’s normally allowed for an artificer of your
      level.</p></li><li><p>When you finish a short rest (instead of when you
      gain a level in this class), you can replace one of the artificer cantrips
      you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list or your
      Breakthrough spell list. This cantrip is considered an artificer cantrip
      for you.</p></li></ul>
