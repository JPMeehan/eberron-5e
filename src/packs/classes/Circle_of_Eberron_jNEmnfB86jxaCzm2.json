      "value": "<p>Druids of the Circle of Eberron communicate with the progenitor Eberron herself. They can hear her words in the passage of the winds, and read her messages in leaves of the forest and shifting sands of the desert. These druids believe in the sacredness of all life, and can entreat the world to provide them with an ally formed out of Eberron's body in times of need. They are staunch opponents of extraplanar creatures that seek to impose their will on their world, such as creatures from Khyber and Xoriat.</p><p>Many Gatekeepers find themselves drawn to this circle, as well as hermits who spend decades listening to the heartbeat of the Dragon Between. Adepts of this tradition can also be found among iredar kobolds and Talentan mask weavers. And to the surprise of many, warforged that seek deep connections to the earth might follow this circle, including the warforged Followers of the Broken Path and the Landforged Walkers. </p>",
