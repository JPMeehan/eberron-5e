      <p>When you take damage from a creature you can see within 60 feet of you,
      as a reaction you can force that creature to make an Intelligence saving
      throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes
      2d10 force damage.</p><p> The damage increases to 3d10 when you reach 17th
      level in this class.</p>
