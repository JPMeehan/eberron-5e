      <p>At 9th level, you have learned how to unleash your psicrystal's deeper
      potential. Whenever you use your Psionic Augmentation feature, you can
      coalesce the released emotion into a crystalline construct. In addition to
      targeting a creature with an augmentation effect, you create an astral
      construct imbued with that emotion in a space within 30 feet of you, which
      lasts for one minute or until it is reduced to 0 hit points. If you
      already have an astral construct shaped when you use your Psionic
      Augmentation, you instead fully heal your current construct, extend its
      duration by a further minute, and imbue it with an additional use of its
      Release Emotion action.</p><p>In combat, the astral construct shares your
      initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can
      move on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge
      action, unless you take bonus action on your turn to command it to take
      one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, or Help
      action.</p>
