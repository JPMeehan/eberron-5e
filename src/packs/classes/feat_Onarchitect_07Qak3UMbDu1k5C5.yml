      <p>You learn the spells dream and dreamwalk*, which you can scribe into
      your spellbook at no cost. You count as having both spells prepared at all
      times, which do not count towards your prepared spell
      limit.</p><p>Additionally, if you touch a creature that you have magically
      put to sleep, you can charm it with mesmerizing dreams, affecting its
      behavior in the waking world. Creatures immune to being charmed are
      unaffected. Choose one of the following options:</p><ul><li>You can ask
      one question of the creature, which answers it truthfully to the best of
      its ability if it can speak a language.</li><li>With you concentrating (as
      though on a spell), the creature sleepwalks, and follows behind you at
      half its normal speed. The creature follows you for up to 10 minutes,
      until it wakes up, or until you lose concentration. If the creature would
      be made to move into an environment that would cause it harm (such as long
      drop, fire, or water), its subconscious kicks in, allowing it to make a
      Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC to wake up
      first.</li><li>It forgets the last minute of events before it fell asleep,
      regarding them as a strange hazy nightmare.</li></ul><p>You can use this
      ability once, and regain the ability to do so upon completing a short or
      long rest.</p>
