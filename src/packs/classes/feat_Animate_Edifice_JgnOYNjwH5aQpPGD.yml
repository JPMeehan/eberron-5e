      <p>At 14th level, you can animate a massive statue or building to fight
      for you. As an action, choose a Huge nonmagical building, object, or other
      collection of inorganic material (such as metal rubbish or a rock
      formation) within 100 feet of you. It animates, becoming an animated
      edifice under your control for the next 10 minutes or until it is reduced
      to 0 hit points. Any contents of the structure, including creatures and
      objects within and on it, are unharmed by its animation, and creatures can
      follow normal rules of movement to navigate the structure while it is
      animated. If the edifice moves or takes any action other than the Dodge
      action on its turn, every foot of movement costs an extra foot for any
      creatures within or on it until the start of the edifice's next
      turn.</p><p>On your turn, you can mentally command the edifice where to
      move (no action required by you). The only action it takes on its turn is
      the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command
      it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash or Disengage
      action.</p><p>After 10 minutes or when the edifice is reduced to 0 hit
      points, the animated edifice reverts to its original unanimated state,
      regardless of its current location. The structure's condition is the same
      as from before it was animated; however, if it reverted as a result of
      dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its original
      form.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
