    value: >-
      <p>When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can steal that
      creature’s soul and keep it joined with your own. While a creature’s soul
      is joined to yours, that creature can be restored to life only by a wish
      spell.</p><p>Additionally, when you have to make a death saving throw, you
      can instead choose to release a soul you have stolen. When you do so, you
      regain 1 hit point, and that soul is no longer joined to yours.</p>
