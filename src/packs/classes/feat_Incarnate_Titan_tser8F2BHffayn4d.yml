      <p>You can call on the magic of the giants to grow to a towering size with
      barely-contained power. When you cast a sorcerer spell and expend a spell
      slot, you can choose to enter your Titan State before the spell resolves,
      gaining the following benefits until it ends:</p><ul><li>Your size
      increases to Large, and your reach increases by 5 feet.</li><li>You gain a
      bonus to Strength ability checks and saving throws equal to your Charisma
      modifier.</li><li>You gain temporary hit points equal to 5 x the level of
      the expended spell slot.</li><li>When you deal damage with a non-cantrip
      spell (including the spell cast to enter Titan state), you can choose to
      lose a number of hit points equal to the level of the spell. Doing so does
      not force any saving throws to maintain concentration. If you do so, one
      creature that took damage from the spell takes additional force damage
      equal to twice the hit points lost. You can choose to lose hit points in
      this way any number of times, choosing a different creature to take the
      damage every time you do so.</li></ul><p>This state lasts for 1 minute, or
      until you end it as a bonus action. Once used, you cannot use this ability
      again until you complete a long or short rest.</p>
