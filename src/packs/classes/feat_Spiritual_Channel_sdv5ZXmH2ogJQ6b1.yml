      <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain the ability to
      call forth a spirit and borrow its power. After you finish a long rest
      during which you spent at least 30 minutes meditating, you can call one of
      the following spirit types to inhabit you, gaining its benefits until you
      next use this feature to call a different spirit. You can only have one
      spirit inhabiting you at a time; if you call another spirit to inhabit
      you, you lose the benefits of the spirit that previously inhabited you.
      Any time you use this feature to cause a target to make a saving throw,
      use your ki save DC.</p><h5> Eldritch Spirit</h5> <p>When you call this
      spirit, you can throw bolts of raw arcane force. As an action, make a
      ranged spell attack with a range of 60 feet. On a hit, you throw a single
      blast of force that deals force damage equal to your Martial Arts die +
      your Wisdom modifier. When you reach certain levels in this class, you
      learn to throw additional blasts as part of the same action, increasing to
      two blasts at 5th level, three at 11th level, and four at 17th
      level.</p><h5> Spirit of Conflict</h5> <p>When you call this spirit, you
      gain a +1 bonus to all melee damage rolls made with a monk weapon or
      unarmed strike. This bonus increases when you reach certain levels in this
      class, increasing to +2 at 5th level, +3 at 11th level, and +4 at 17th
      level. Additionally, when you see a hostile creature within 15 feet of you
      reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to move up to half your
      speed without provoking opportunity attacks and make one melee
      attack.</p><h5> Spirit of Eloquence</h5> <p>When you call this spirit, you
      gain proficiency with Insight and Persuasion; if you already have
      proficiency in one or both of these skills, your proficiency bonus is
      doubled for that skill. In addition, you can charm a creature with a
      touch. As an action, you cause a creature within 5 feet of you to make a
      Wisdom saving throw, rolled with advantage if you or your companions are
      fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you for one
      hour or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The
      charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the effect
      ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you. If the creature succeeds
      on its saving throw, it is immune to being charmed by this feature for 24
      hours.</p><h5> Spirit of Subtlety</h5> <p>When you call this spirit, you
      gain proficiency with Deception and Stealth; if you already have
      proficiency in one or both of these skills, your proficiency bonus is
      doubled for that skill. In addition, once per turn, you can deal an extra
      1d4 points of damage when you hit with an unarmed attack or a monk weapon
      if you did not suffer disadvantage on the attack roll. This extra damage
      increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d4
      at 5th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 17th level.</p><h5> Stalwart
      Spirit</h5> <p>When you call this spirit, you can minimize damage dealt by
      melee attacks. As a reaction to being hit with a melee attack, you can
      reduce the damage you take from the attack by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier
      + your monk level. Additionally, when you use your reaction with this
      feature or with your Deflect Missiles feature, you gain a bonus to your AC
      equal to +1 until the end of your next turn. This bonus increases when you
      reach certain levels in this class, increasing to +2 at 5th level, +3 at
      11th level, and +4 at 17th level.</p>
