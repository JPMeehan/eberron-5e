      <p>At 3rd level, you learn to share the truths of your knowledge with
      others, whether they will it or not. When you cast a spell of 1st level or
      higher, you can use one of the following Revelatory Moment options of your
      choice.</p><h5> Moment of Clarity</h5> <p>You can expend one use of your
      Bardic Inspiration to bestow insight on an ally. One ally within 30 feet
      of you that is charmed, frightened, or stunned can immediately make
      another saving throw against the effect that imposed the condition, even
      if it would not otherwise get to make another save to end the effect
      early. The ally gets a bonus on its saving throw equal to the number you
      roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. On a successful save, the effect
      ends.</p><h5> Moment of Madness</h5> <p>You can expend one use of your
      Bardic Inspiration to cloud the mind of another creature. Choose one
      creature that you hit with a spell attack or that failed a saving throw
      against the spell you cast. That creature takes a penalty on its next
      ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made before the end of your
      next turn. The penalty equals the number you roll on the Bardic
      Inspiration die.</p><h5> Moment of Passion</h5> <p>You can expend one use
      of your Bardic Inspiration to reinvigorate the soul. Choose one creature
      within 30 feet of you that can hear you. It heals hit points equal to the
      number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma
      modifier.</p><h5> Moment of Potency</h5> <p>You can expend one use of your
      Bardic Inspiration to imbue the spell you are casting with the ferocity of
      your will. The spell's attack modifier or save DC increases by 1, and one
      target of your choice who you hit with the spell attack or that fails its
      saving throw against the spell takes psychic damage equal to the number
      you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.</p>
