      "value": "<p>The Oath of Freedom is a vow to fight back against the tyrants, conquerors, and slavers who would use their power to oppress others. Paladins who swear this oath believe that all have the right to dictate their own path, and often act as noble revolutionaries and freedom fighters. When an invading army oppresses a nation, when a tyrant king imprisons his people, or a criminal group begins dealing in lives, that is when the Oath of Freedom rises.</p><p> In Xenâ€™drik, both the Unbound Brigade and the Silaes Tairn often embody the Oath, fighting against the giants who once enslaved them and their kin. Their sworn enemies are those such as the Battalion of Basalt Towers, who would use ancient magic to rule over the continent once more. In Khorvaire, Oath of Freedom paladins arose during the Last War, especially in conquered cities such as Thaliost, or rebelling nations such as the Eldeen Reaches and Darguun.</p>",
