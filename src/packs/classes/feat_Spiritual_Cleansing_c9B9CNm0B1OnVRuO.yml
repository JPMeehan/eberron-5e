    value: >-
      <p>From 1st level, your faith empowers you to break charms and force out
      possessing entities. As an action, you touch a creature that is possessed
      or charmed and cause them to immediately make another saving throw to
      resist the effect imposing that condition. On a successful save, the
      effect ends, and if it was possessed, it automatically succeeds on saving
      throws against possession from the creature that possessed it for the next
      10 days. If a creature is both possessed and charmed, it makes a save
      against each effect.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times
      equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended
      uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
