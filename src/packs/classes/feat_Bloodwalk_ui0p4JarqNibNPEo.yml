    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 18th level, you can step into the blood of others, using
      them as pathways to burst forth from the blood of others nearby. Once per
      turn, you can use 10 feet of your movement to teleport into a living
      creature within 5 feet of you and emerge from a second living creature
      within 100 feet of the first creature, appearing in an unoccupied space
      within 5 feet of the second creature. You do not need to be able to see
      the second creature to exit, as you instinctively sense the presence of
      blood near your destination.</p><p>When you use this feature, you can
      choose to deal damage to one or both creatures you teleport through,
      causing the target to make a Constitution saving throw against your
      sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 4d6 points of necrotic
      damage.</p><p>This feature has no effect on constructs, elementals,
      plants, and undead.</p>
