      "value": "<p>Starting at 14th level, the Dragon Below bestows upon you a special Khyber dragonshard. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or less, you may immediately activate this feature to permanently bind that creature within your pact-given Khyber dragonshard. Upon doing so, the creature's body disappears and their mind and soul become trapped within the dragonshard. While trapped, the target creature is conscious but cannot take actions. You can read the mind of a trapped creature as if you had cast detect thoughts, however the trapped creature automatically fails any saving throw to resist. If you have trapped a creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or lower, or one which doesn't speak any language, then you can only learn the emotional state of that creature.</p><p>The trapped creature is freed immediately if you bind the soul of another creature or if your pact-given Khyber dragonshard is shattered. A freed creature appears in the same space as the Khyber dragonshard with 1 hit point.</p><p> If your pact-given Khyber dragonshard is destroyed, you may generate a new one when you finish a long rest.</p>",
