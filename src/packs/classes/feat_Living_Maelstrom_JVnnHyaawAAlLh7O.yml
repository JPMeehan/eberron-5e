      <p>At 6th level, you can scatter your form and avoid trouble, adopting the
      visage of an elemental of choice. As an action, you can expend one use of
      your Wild Shape feature to give yourself the effects of the mirror image
      spell, except it lasts for ten minutes instead of one. On each turn until
      this form ends, you may teleport as a bonus action to an unoccupied space
      within 30f</p>
