      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can pour
      your psionic essence into a crystal you touch, storing your emotions
      safely out of harm's reach. Select two emotions from the Psicrystal
      Affinities table, storing them in your psicrystal; the crystal can't hold
      the same emotion twice. While you have an emotion stored in your
      psicrystal, you gain the stored benefit of that emotion as listed on the
      table. The range of emotions you can choose from expands after you reach
      particular levels in this class, as shown in the table.</p><p>Creating a
      psicrystal requires you to have jeweler's tools on your person, and any
      psicrystal you create with this feature retains all stored emotions until
      the end of your next long rest.</p><p>When you reach certain levels in
      this class, you can imbue your psicrystal with additional emotions at the
      end of a long rest: you can store three emotions at 5th level, four at 9th
      level, and five at 15th level.</p><p>You can store additional emotions in
      your psicrystal by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each
      one. When you do so, you use your action to touch your psicrystal and
      store the emotion in it.</p><table><caption>Psicrystal

      advantage on saving throws against being charmed.</td><td>The target must
      succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become charmed by you or one
      creature you can see for 1 minute or until it takes damage from any
      subsequent effect.</td></tr><tr><td>Fear</td><td>3rd</td><td>You gain
      advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</td><td>The target
      must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become frightened of you
      or one creature you can see for 1 minute or until it takes damage from any
      subsequent effect.</td></tr><tr><td>Disgust</td><td>3rd</td><td>You gain
      advantage on saving throws against any effect that deals poison damage or
      causes the poisoned condition.</td><td>The target must succeed on an
      Intelligence saving throw against your artificer or become poisoned until
      the end of its next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>Sadness</td><td>3rd</td><td>You
      gain advantage on saving throws to resist any effect that would cause you
      to gain a level of exhaustion.</td><td>The target must succeed on an
      Intelligence saving throw or suffer one level of
      exhaustion.</td></tr><tr><td>Anger</td><td>3rd</td><td>Any critical hit
      against you becomes a normal hit.</td><td>The target must succeed on an
      Intelligence saving throw or take an additional 3d6 psychic damage, or
      half that amount on a successful
      save.</td></tr><tr><td>Surprise</td><td>3rd</td><td>You gain advantage on
      initiative rolls.</td><td>The target must succeed on an Intelligence
      saving throw or have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and be unable
      to use reactions until the end of its next
      turn.</td></tr><tr><td>Temerity</td><td>5th</td><td>When you cast an
      artificer spell, one target of your choice can gain a number of temporary
      hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).</td><td>The
      target gains advantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn, and
      its attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or
      20.</td></tr><tr><td>Tranquility</td><td>5th</td><td>When you cast an
      artificer spell, you gain a bonus to one damage roll equal to your
      Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1)</td><td>The target regains a number
      of hit points equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence
      modifier.</td></tr><tr><td>Envy</td><td>15th</td><td>When you cast an
      artificer spell, one target of your choice can regain a number of hit
      points equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).</td><td>The
      target must make an Intelligence saving throw or become overwhelmed with
      envy for 1 minute or until it takes damage from any subsequent effect. On
      its turn, an affected creature must move as close as possible toward one
      object, place, or person you designate that you can both see. A target
      isn't compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or
      pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated
      direction.</td></tr><tr><td>Humility</td><td>15th</td><td>Every enemy
      creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of you takes psychic damage
      equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).</td><td>The target is
      warded against hostile action for 1 minute. Until the effect ends, any
      creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell
      must first make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
      creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This effect
      doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the
      explosion of a fireball.</td></tr></tbody></table>
