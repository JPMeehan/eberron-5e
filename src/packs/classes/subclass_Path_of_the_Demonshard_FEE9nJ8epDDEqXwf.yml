      <p><em>Empower Yourself with a Fiendish Presence</em></p><p>Demonglass
      holds the essence of a fiend—pure malefic power yearning for release. A
      painful, and often lethal, ritual can embed a shard of demonglass in a
      mortal’s body; if the mortal survives, they can draw on the power of the
      fiend. The warriors of the Carrion Tribes in the Demon Wastes and the
      champions of Turakbar’s Fist in Droaam are eager to augment their might in
      this way, but there are others—Znir hwyri, Ghaash’kala—who make this
      sacrifice in order to fight hellfire with hellfire. No matter their
      intention, a Barbarian who walks the Path of the Demonshard may struggle
      to keep the fiendish malice contained.</p>
