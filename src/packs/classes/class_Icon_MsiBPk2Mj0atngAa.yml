      <p>Icons are champions of their own true inner selves, called the “ego.”
      They channel the collective unconscious, a psychic network that
      fundamentally links all sentient minds below the level of conscious
      thought, and draw from it metaphorical masks of disposition and attitude,
      called “personas.” To be an icon means adapting your ego to handle
      whatever comes your way by donning these personas and imbuing them with
      psionic power.</p><h3>Awakening of the Self</h3><p>All icons go through an
      awakening in which they open their mind and soul to the collective
      unconscious. Through this connection, you become able to consciously draw
      on the personas most people adopt subconsciously, and infuse them with
      psionic potential to manifest magical effects.</p><p>Additionally, with
      further understanding of your own psyche and its place in the collective
      unconscious, you may become able to identify and empower the iconic
      archetype that lies at the center of your ego.</p><h3>Face Any
      Challenge</h3><p>Icons use the versatility and adaptability of their
      personas to fit themselves into whatever role they or their allies might
      need. Is the party delving into a dark, ancient jungle? Then adopting The
      Chariot persona to project yourself as a fearless explorer would provide
      you the skills you need to survive. The silver tongue granted by your
      persona of Fortitude, however, might serve you better in negotiations with
      your party’s patron. The strength of an icon is in the repertoire of
      personas they have to draw on.</p><h3>Icons in Eberron</h3><p>The
      potential to access the collective unconscious is latent in all sentient
      minds, and it seemingly arises more naturally in Khorvaire than it does in
      Sarlona, most notably in the western frontiers of the Shadow Marches,
      Eldeen Reaches, and the Demon Wastes. Icons who spontaneously awaken tend
      toward independence, though a few Cults of the Dragon Below boast these
      powerful psionic individuals among their members. Of the rare few icons in
      Khorvaire that deliberately awaken through discipline and meditation,
      changelings are the most common, accessing their race’s latent psionic
      potential to allow themselves to adapt their personalities as well as they
      adapt their bodies.</p><p>While spontaneous awakenings are rarer in
      Sarlona, that continent sports a much higher overall number of icons, as
      training and techniques for facilitating awakening are known among the
      Inspired and other psionic communities. These icons are most often agents
      of the Thousand Eyes, Riedra’s intelligence agency, though many icons are
      cultivated in the monasteries of Adar, and lend their versatile aid in the
      fight to protect the mountainous refuge from the Inspired.</p><p>Among the
      kalashtar, icons are seen as a potential liability. Opening oneself to the
      collective unconscious, they fear, may draw attention from dark forces
      that also draw power or knowledge from the collective minds of mortals,
      such as the demonic Overlords of the first age or the Dreaming Dark. They
      encourage those with the natural talent for psionics towards the paths of
      the Soulknife or Adamant instead. However, kalashtar dissatisfied with the
      guidance of their elders may awaken themselves as icons in order to follow
      their own path, opposing the Dreaming Dark and other forces of darkness in
      their own way, with all of their considerable talents.</p><h3>Creating an
      Icon</h3><p>When creating an icon, consider what it was that triggered
      your awakening. Was it a concerted effort of strict discipline and
      rigorous meditation, or a sudden epiphany that bestowed awareness of the
      collective unconscious unto you? When you parted the mists of your mind to
      reveal the true nature of your ego, were you able to accept what you saw?
      Do you adopt personas to accentuate your ego, or to hide it? Though you
      retain your sense of identity, the outward expression of your ego that you
      present to the world changes from situation to situation. Are these
      changes subtle and nearly indistinguishable from the mundane moods and
      attitudes others might find themselves adopting, or are they noticeable
      and disconcerting to those who witness the shift?</p>
