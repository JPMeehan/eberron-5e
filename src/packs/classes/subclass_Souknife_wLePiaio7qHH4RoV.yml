    value: >-
      <p>Most rogues perfect the art of deadly combat with easily concealed
      physical weapons. The Soulknife, however, needs no physical weapon at all,
      instead manifesting their deadly weapons with the power of their mind.
      They are excellent assassins and undercover agents, summoning a weapon in
      a heartbeat where an opponent expects an unarmed foe.</p><p>Psionic power
      is the easiest route to learning the basic tenets of this pathâ€”manifesting
      a mindblade. As a result, most Soulknives are either kalashtar or denizens
      of Sarlona, though the spark of psionic power might be found in any of the
      common races.</p><p>Two other traditions have evolved among elves, neither
      of them psionic. Rarely, elves with the Mark of Shadow have learned to
      manipulate the darkness to form solid blades. Meanwhile, the Umbragen of
      Xen'drik have discovered how to manifest blades of pure darkness through
      the pact of their people with the Umbra. </p>
