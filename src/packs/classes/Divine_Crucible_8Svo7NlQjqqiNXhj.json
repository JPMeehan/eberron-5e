      "value": "<p>Divine Crucibles are the smiths of the gods, forging relics in radiant flame. Their craftwork is belief, and their belief lies in the glory of their craft. When heroes seek out blessed weapons to smite evil, it’s Crucibles who provide. It is said that each one places a divine spark in their masterpieces; in battle, they can ignite these sparks, causing the relics to flare with holy fire, and bolster their wielders.</p><p> Crucibles can be found across Eberron, serving the Silver Flame, or gods of the forge such as Onatar. The Ghaash’kala and Shulassakar both rely on skilled Crucibles to forge and shape songsilver - the unbreakable essence of the couatl. In Xen’drik, the fire giants of the Torch of Progress see the silver flame as a force for peace and enlightenment, and create items to support the people. Their kin within the hidden city of Daomon once powered their forges with the Fernian fires of Onatar, creating sacred relics of the Sovereigns - though the Shattering has scattered their works to the ashes of time</p>",
