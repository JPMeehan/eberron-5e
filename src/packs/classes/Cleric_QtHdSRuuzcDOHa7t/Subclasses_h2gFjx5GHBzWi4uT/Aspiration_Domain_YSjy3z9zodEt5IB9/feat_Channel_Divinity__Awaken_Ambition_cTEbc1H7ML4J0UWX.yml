    value: >-
      <p>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke the secrets of the Shadow,
      allowing you and your charges to turn forbidden potential into strength.
      As an action, you and each willing creature of your choice that you can
      see within 15 feet of you take necrotic damage equal to 1d10 plus your
      Wisdom modifier, and gain twice that many temporary hit points. This
      damage can't be reduced in any way.</p>
