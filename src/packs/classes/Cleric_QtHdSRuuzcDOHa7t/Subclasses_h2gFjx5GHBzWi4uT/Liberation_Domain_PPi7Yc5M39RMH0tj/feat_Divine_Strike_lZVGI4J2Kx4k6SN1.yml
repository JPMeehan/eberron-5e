      <p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with
      divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a
      weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant
      damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
      increases to 2d8.</p>
