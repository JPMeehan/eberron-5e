    value: >-
      <p>At 17th level, you gain immunity to being charmed. If a creature tries
      to charm you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
      DC. On a failure, it takes 4d10+your Wisdom modifier psychic damage and is
      stunned until the end of your next turn, or half as much and has no other
      effects on a success</p>
