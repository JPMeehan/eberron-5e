    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to disrupt a
      foeâ€™s mind. When a creature within 30 feet of you has to make a Wisdom
      saving throw, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it using
      your Channel Divinity. You must use this feature before you know the
      outcome of the roll.</p><p> If the spell or effect that caused the Wisdom
      saving throw is not created by a spell you cast, you can also choose to
      deal psychic damage to the target, equal to half your cleric level,
      immediately before the target makes its saving throw.</p>
