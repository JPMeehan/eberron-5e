    value: >-
      <p>Your spiritual savvy manifests as material wealth. When you finish a
      Long Rest, you conjure two divine coins and lose any previously unspent
      divine coins. Whenever you make a saving throw against a magical effect
      caused by a hostile creature, you can choose to spend a divine coin or
      gain a divine coin. You must choose whether or not to spend a coin before
      you roll your save. </p><p><em><strong>Spend a Coin.</strong></em> Roll a
      d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. </p><p><em><strong>Gain
      a Coin.</strong></em> Roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the
      saving throw. </p><p>The number of divine coins you conjure when you
      finish a Long Rest changes when you reach certain Cleric levels. You
      conjure three at level 5, four at level 9, five at level 13, and six at
      level 17.</p>
