    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
      admonishing Undead for acting against you. Each Undead creature that can
      see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw
      against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is rebuked for
      1 minute or until it takes damage. A rebuked creature drops Prone and
      cannot take actions or reactions, instead cowering and groveling in
      place.</p><p> When you would gain the Destroy Undead feature, this Channel
      Divinity option instead controls Undead of the same CR as those destroyed
      by Channel Divinity: Turn Undead. Instead of being destroyed, Undead of
      the appropriate CR are placed under your control for 24 hours, and obey
      your verbal commands. You can control a number of Undead in this way up to
      your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), remaining targets are rebuked as normal.
      </p><p>Undead under your control automatically fail the saving throw
      against your Rebuke Undead.</p>
