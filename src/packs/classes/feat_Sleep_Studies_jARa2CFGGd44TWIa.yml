    value: >-
      <p>While asleep, you can scribe spells into your spellbook using the
      required amount of time and gold as though you were awake. Your body
      performs the necessary writing while your lucid mind unlocks the secrets
      of the arcane.</p><p> Additionally, you learn the spell dream link*, which
      you can scribe into your spellbook at no cost. You count as having dream
      link* prepared at all times, which does not count towards your prepared
      spell limit.</p>
