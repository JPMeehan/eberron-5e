      "value": "<p>Bone Knights are Karrn patriots, living protectors who fight alongside the undead legions of their land. During the Last War, they provided tactical expertise and controlled the legions of undead that the Blood of Vol priesthood raised to defend the Karrnathi people.</p><p>Although the founders of the order of Bone Knights were powerful members of the Emerald Claw, they recruited freely from amongst the populace, seeking those with the ability and willpower to control the dead, rather than prioritizing matters of faith. In post-war Karrnath, the surviving Bone Knights are elite emissaries who travel abroad to complete missions that serve the greater glory of Karrnath and King Kaius III. The only recognized Bone Knight training facilities are located in Karrnath, and most come from that grim land. However, the Order of the Emerald Claw pioneered the order, so a new trainee could crop up anywhere their reach extends.</p><p>Though unknown to most of Khorvaire, similar traditions exist amongst the elves of the Bloodsail Principality and in Aerenal itself. Rumors of an ancient and powerful group of elven necromancers in the Xen'drik jungles could also lead to this path.</p><h5><span class=\"fontstyle0\">T</span>enets of the Bone Knight</h5><p>Sworn to the service of Karrnath, these knights follow a simple code.</p><p><em><strong>Never Bow Down.</strong></em> You are the elite. Do not kneel to one who has not proven your superior unless ordered by the Crown.</p><p><em><strong>Hold Firm.</strong></em> Commanding legions of undead requires an iron will and confidence. Resist temptations and do not make excuses for poor behavior. Learn from your mistakes so that you do not repeat them.</p><p><em><strong>Bound by Loyalty.</strong></em> Your word is your life. Once you have sworn your service to another, you will serve to death and beyond, if necessary. However, if they prove unworthy of your service, dispense the necessary judgment and find another who is worthy. <br /></p>",
