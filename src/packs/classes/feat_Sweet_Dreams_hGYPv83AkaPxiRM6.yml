    value: >-
      <p>When you fall asleep or are knocked unconscious, you are unaffected by
      the negative effects of the condition, but are instead considered blinded
      and lose any ongoing concentration. As a result, you do not fall prone
      (unless you choose) and can move and act as normal. If you are knocked
      unconscious as a result of being reduced to 0 hit points, you continue to
      make death saving throws while in this state.</p><p> Additionally, your
      dreams cannot be affected by other creatures, spells, or magical effects
      unless you allow it.</p>
