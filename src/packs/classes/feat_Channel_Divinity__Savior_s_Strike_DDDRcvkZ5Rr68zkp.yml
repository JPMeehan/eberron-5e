    value: >-
      <p>You can use your Channel Divinity to save your allies from harmâ€™s way
      when you hit a creature with a melee attack, marking it for a quick
      downfall. On a hit, the creature gains disadvantage on all attacks against
      creatures other than you for 1 minute, until you end your turn without
      making an attack against that creature, become incapacitated, or fall
      unconscious. While marked in this way, If the creature is at least one
      size larger than you, or grappling an ally, you deal an additional 1d6
      radiant damage when you hit it with an attack for the first time on your
      turn.</p>
