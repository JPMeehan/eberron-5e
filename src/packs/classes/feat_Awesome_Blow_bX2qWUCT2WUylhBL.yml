    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, spiritual power from your patron lends you the
      ability to land decisive hits. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with
      a weapon attack, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against
      your warlock spell save DC or suffer your choice of one of the following
      effects:</p><ul><li>Its speed is reduced to 0 and it can't take reactions
      until the start of its next turn.</li><li>It becomes frightened of you
      until the end of its next turn.</li><li>It becomes deafened until the end
      of its next turn and has disadvantage on the next saving throw that it
      makes before the end of its next turn.</li></ul><p>You can use this
      feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of
      once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long
      rest.</p><p>Starting at 10th level, you can use this feature once per
      turn, with no other limitations on how many times you can use it per short
      or long rest.</p>
