      "value": "<p>At 14th level, you feel the pulse of Eberron's heartbeat in your own veins, and in moments of oneness, can transform into a dragonlike form of greenery and flora. As an action while touching unworked earth, unworked stone, or a body of water, you transform into a twilight guardian.</p><p>You can stay in this form for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down), then revert to your normal form. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed into your twilight guardian form, you follow the same rules as if you were in your Wild Shape.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
