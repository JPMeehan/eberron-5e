  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Strutting through the battlefield turns the heads of your enemies,
      giving your allies a chance to strike. As an action, you affect your
      movement, allowing you to target a number of creatures up to your Charisma
      modifier that you move within 5 feet of this turn. Targeted creatures must
      succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become
      incapacitated until the start of your next turn, or until they take
      damage. On a success, they become immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
