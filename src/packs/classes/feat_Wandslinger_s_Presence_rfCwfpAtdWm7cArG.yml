    value: >-
      <p>You know how to talk yourself up and tear your opponents down. If you
      speak to a creature for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to distract and
      rattle them when the call to action finally comes. If the creature rolls
      an Initiative count equal to or higher than your own, it must make a
      Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the
      creatureâ€™s Initiative is reduced to be equal to yours, and it acts
      immediately after you in the Initiative order.</p>
