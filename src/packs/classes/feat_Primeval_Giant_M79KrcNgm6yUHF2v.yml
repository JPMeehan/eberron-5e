      druid level divided by 3 (rounded down) if it is naturally Huge, a
      dinosaur, or has the dinosaur subtype. You ignore the Max. CR column of
      the Beast Shapes table in this way, but must abide by the other
      limitations there.</p><p>Additionally, while you have taken the form of a
      Beast that is size Large or larger, you provide half cover to allies
      behind you.</p>
