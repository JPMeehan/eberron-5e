      "value": "<p>Beginning at 10th level, if you live in a city for at least a month, you can claim it as part of your territory, up to a number of cities equal to your proficiency bonus. You can designate a new claimed city if you stay within its borders for at least a month, and you can choose which city to remove from your territory if claiming a new one would exceed your maximum.</p><p>When you finish a long rest in a claimed city, you can spend 10 minutes concentrating on thoughts of another city you have claimed on the same plane of existence as you, then teleport yourself to a public location of your choice in that city. When you do so, you can expend one spell slot to simultaneously transport other willing creatures with you; for every level of the spell slot you expend, you can transport one additional creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you. Every creature teleported in this manner appears in the nearest unoccupied square to you.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
