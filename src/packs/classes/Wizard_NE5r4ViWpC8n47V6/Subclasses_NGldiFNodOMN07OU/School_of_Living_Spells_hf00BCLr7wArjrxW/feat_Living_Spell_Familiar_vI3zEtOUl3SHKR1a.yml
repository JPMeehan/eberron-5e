      <p>When you dedicate yourself to this school at 2nd level, you add the
      find familiar spell to your spellbook and have the option to create a
      living cantrip as a variant familiar. This familiar is a semi-sentient
      spell formed from your own arcane power. When you cast the find familiar
      spell to create a living cantrip, you can do so without material
      components.</p><p>When you cast any spell, regardless of its range, your
      living cantrip familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell.
      Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, you must be able to see it,
      and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the
      spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.
      For example, while your familiar is 60 feet away from you, you could cast
      thunderwave, which has a range of self, but count your familiar as the
      origin point of the spell's blast wave.</p><p>When you reach certain
      levels in this class, you learn to imbue more powerful spells into your
      living cantrip familiar. Starting at 5th level, when you finish a short or
      long rest, you can expend a spell slot of a level indicated on the Imbued
      Living Spell Familiar table to imbue your living cantrip familiar with a
      damage dealing spell of that level that has a casting time of 1 action and
      requires no costly material component. When you do so, your familiar
      transforms into a more powerful living spell with full hit points, as
      indicated on the Imbued Living Spell Familiar table. While in this form,
      it gains the ability to take the Attack action on its turn, unlike other
      familiars. You can use your reaction on the familiar's turn to command it
      to cast the spell you imbued in it at its lowest level, using your wizard
      spell save DC and attack bonus instead of its own. (Instructions for
      customizing stat blocks for each type of familiar are provided in the
      section on "Customizing Living Spell Familiars". Unlike living spells
      found in the wild, your living spell familiar does not have the recharging
      Spell Mimicry feature, and can only cast the spell it is created from one
      time before it reverts to its living cantrip form).</p><p>When imbued with
      a spell, your familiar keeps this form until it casts the spell imbued in
      it, takes a long rest, or drops to 0 hit points, then it reverts to its
      normal living cantrip form, returning to the number of hit points it had
      before it transformed. However, if it reverts as a result of dropping to 0
      hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. If the
      spell it cast with Unleash Spell requires concentration, your familiar
      must maintain concentration on the spell once in living cantrip
      form.</p><table><caption>Imbued Living Spell

      Familiars</h5> <p>In the Living Spell Familiar feature for the School of
      Living Spells, you gain access to three more powerful forms of your living
      cantrip familiar: the <b>least living spell</b>, <b>lesser living
      spell</b>, and <b>greater living spell</b> familiar. Instructions for
      customizing the stat blocks for these living spell familiars are provided
      here.</p><p>When you imbue your living cantrip familiar with a spell,
      consult the Living Spell Familiar Customization table to see which example
      stat block to customize, based on the chosen spell's
      level.</p><table><caption>Living Spell Familiar
      Customization</caption><thead><tr><th data-rd-isroller="false">Spell
      Level</th><th data-rd-isroller="false">Familiar Type</th><th
      data-rd-isroller="false">Stat Block to
      Customize</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-2</td><td>Least living spell
      familiar</td><td>Living burning hands
      familiar</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>Lesser living spell
      familiar</td><td>Living lightning bolt
      familiar</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>greater living spell
      familiar</td><td>Living cloudkill familiar</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now
      make the following changes to that stat block:</p> Damage Immunity.
      <p>Replace the living spell familiar's damage immunity with immunity to
      the type (or types) of damage dealt by the chosen spell.</p> Magical
      Psuedopod. <p>Replace the damage that Magical Pseudopod deals with one
      type of damage dealt by the chosen spell.</p> Unleash Spell. <p>Replace
      the effect of Unleash Spell with the effect of the chosen spell. If that
      spell requires a saving throw or attack roll, use your wizard spell save
      DC and attack bonus instead of the familiar's own. After the living spell
      familiar uses its Unleash Spell ability, it ceases to be a living spell
      familiar and reverts to its living cantrip familiar form, as described in
      your Living Spell Familiar feature.</p><p>For example, if you turn
      fireball (a 3rd-level spell) into a living spell familiar, you are
      creating a lesser living spell and should customize the living lightning
      bolt familiar. The resulting living fireball familiar has immunity to fire
      damage instead of lightning damage; deals fire damage with its Magical
      Pseudopod; and can replicate fireball once with Unleash Spell, after which
      it reverts to a living cantrip familiar.</p>
