      <p>Starting at 2nd level, your long contact with daelkyr and other
      powerful denizens of Xoriat has altered you in mind and body. You grow one
      of the following symbionts of your choice, gaining its benefits. This
      symbiont is part of your body; if you wish to remove your symbiont (for
      example, to hide your true nature from those who would not understand the
      Truth you have found), you can do so over the course of 1 hour, which can
      be done during a short rest. You can regrow a removed symbiont or mutate
      your personal symbiont into a new form when you finish a long rest, losing
      the benefits of the old symbiont and gaining the benefits of the new
      one.</p><h5> Eye Stalk</h5> <p>A long, flexible tentacle with a single
      eyeball on the end grows out of your neck. While your eye stalk is
      extended and uncovered, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You
      gain darkvision out to a range of 90 feet. If you already have darkvision
      from your race, its range increases by 60 feet.</li><li>You have advantage
      on all Wisdom (Perception) checks.</li><li>You can't be surprised while
      you are awake.</li><li>As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a
      spell slot to gain truesight. Your truesight lasts for 1 round if you
      expend a spell slot of 1st or 2nd level, 1 minute if you expend a spell
      slot of 3rd, 4th, or 5th level, and 1 hour if you expend a spell slot of
      6th level or higher. The radius of your truesight is a number of feet
      equal to ten times the level of the spell slot expended.</li></ul><h5>
      Living Breastplate</h5> <p>You grow armor made out of slick chitin and
      pulsing organic material that merges seamlessly with your body. You gain
      the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your Armor Class becomes 14 + your
      Dexterity modifier (maximum +2).</li><li>You have advantage on death
      saving throws.</li><li>As a reaction when you take damage, you can expend
      a spell slot to reduce the damage by three times the level of the spell
      slot expended.</li><li>When you use your Arcane Recovery class feature,
      your wizard level is counted as 2 levels higher than the number of levels
      you have in this class.</li></ul><h5> Spellgrubs</h5> <p>Dozens of tiny
      grubs continually burrow in and out of your arm and hold secrets of arcane
      power. When you grow this symbiont, choose a 1st-level spell from the
      warlock spell list. The spellgrubs know this spell, it counts as a wizard
      spell for you, and you can add it to your list of spells prepared, though
      it does not count toward your limit. When you finish a long rest, you can
      replace this spell with a different spell from the warlock spell
      list.</p><p>The spellgrubs learn more powerful spells when you reach
      certain levels in this class, adding a 2nd-level spell when you reach 5th
      level, and a 3rd-level spell when you reach 9th level. When you finish a
      long rest, you can replace one or more of these in the same manner as the
      1st-level spell.</p><h5> Scything Limb</h5> <p>You grow a chitinous spine
      on an aberrant third limb, reminiscent of a praying mantis. This limb can
      be controlled as easily as your own, effectively giving you a third hand.
      In addition, if your scything limb is not holding anything when you cast a
      spell, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with its
      spine. You can use your choice of Strength or Dexterity for the attack
      roll, and on a hit, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength
      or Dexterity modifier + psychic damage equal to twice the level of the
      spell you cast that turn.</p>
