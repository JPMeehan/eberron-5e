      <p>All Blood Magi have one thing in common. You died. It might have been
      at birth, and no one bothered to tell you. Or perhaps you died later in
      life, then were subsequently called back from the misty embrace of
      Dolurrh. Whatever the cause, you were dead, briefly—and it will not happen
      again. You seek to first master the power of your own blood so you will
      never be defenseless, then as you increase in power, you hear the siren
      call of the blood of others.</p><p>Due to the cost of this power, it's
      rare to encounter another Blood Magus in the world, as most practitioners
      of this art are scattered. The most common place to find a Blood Magus is
      in Karrnath and anywhere the Blood of Vol faith is strong, as adherents of
      this faith understand the intricate link of blood and power. The Bloodsail
      Principality in Lhazaar holds Blood Magi both living and undead; as
      vampires possess the most neceesary of components—blood—they too can learn
      this art. Rumors also tell of Blood Magi hiding deep in the Shadow Marches
      and the Demon Wastes. </p>
