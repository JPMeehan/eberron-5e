    value: >-
      <p>You have modified your battlefist in both mundane and magical ways. It
      gains the following benefits: </p><ul><li><p>When you infuse your
      battlefist, you can apply two infusions to it at a time. If both infusions
      grant bonuses to your attack rolls or armor class, you gain only the
      greater bonus. </p></li><li><p>Your battlefist is also a shield,
      increasing your armor class by 2. You can wield it as a weapon even if you
      are using it as a shield. You can infuse it as if it were both a simple
      melee weapon and a shield. </p></li><li><p>The maximum number of items you
      can infuse at once increases by 1, but the extra infusion must be applied
      to your battlefist</p></li></ul>
