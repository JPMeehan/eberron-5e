      "value": "<p>Since the dawn of time, mortals have gazed with wonder and fear upon the titans of the natural world. Behemoth druids are those who find strength in the existence of such giants, for what greater sign can there be of the power of nature? Many find purpose in living alongside whales, dinosaurs, and other immense beasts, protecting them from harmful poaching and unnatural threats. In doing so, they gain insights into their roles in nature - and learn to take on their forms to terrifying effect.</p><p> Behemoth druids can be found wherever such creatures congregate, from the mountain aeries of giant eagles, to the vast plains on which sauropods roam. Some are more than happy to welcome visitors, as long as they agree not to disturb the titans before them. Others are brutal and wild, tracking prey alongside powerful dinosaurs and predatory beasts. Perhaps the strangest are those who live in the Astral Plane, and ride beneath the stars with celestial kindori whales.</p>",
