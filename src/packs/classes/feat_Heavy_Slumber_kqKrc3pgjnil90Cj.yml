    value: >-
      <p>When you cast a spell with an instantaneous duration that deals damage,
      you can instead choose to forgo all potential damage to attempt to send
      affected creatures into a magical slumber. Roll the spellâ€™s damage die as
      normal. If a creature has hit points equal to or lower than the amount of
      damage they would have taken + your wizard level, they immediately fall
      asleep and become unconscious. Creatures immune to being charmed are
      unaffected. Creatures fall asleep for a number of hours equal to the level
      of the spell cast, with the exception of cantrips, which cause a creature
      to fall asleep for 1 minute. A sleeping creature wakes up if they take
      damage, or if another creature uses an action to slap or shake them
      awake</p>
