    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 17th level, when you draw back your luminous arrow on its
      bowstring, you can choose to project it as a dazzling ray of sun. As an
      action, you create a beam of sunlight that is 120 feet long and 5 feet
      wide, extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the
      line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
      takes 10d6 radiant damage, and is blinded until the end of your next turn.
      On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and is not
      blinded. The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency
      bonus + your Charisma modifier.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't
      use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
