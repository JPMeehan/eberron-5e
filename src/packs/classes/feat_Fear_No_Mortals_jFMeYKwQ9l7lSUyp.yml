    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, your patron shows you the true meaning of
      fear, but you have learned how to accept it, then turn it back on its
      maker. You are immune to being frightened. Additionally, as a reaction to
      a creature attempting to frighten you, you can turn the fear on it
      instead, causing the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your
      warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is frightened of you for 1
      minute or until it takes any damage.</p>
