      <p>As a crystal shaper, you have closely studied the mystical properties
      of quartz, ruby, and sapphire. Within the precise layers and cleaved edges
      of each crystal lattice is the potential to awaken vast psionic magics.
      Far beyond the careful meditations of psions or the explosive power of
      wilders, you have learned how to use crystal structures to construct a
      reservoir for your own psyche. After all, your mind is a tool to be
      harnessed just like any other in your supply.</p><p>The crystal shaping
      tradition first appeared among the Inspired, the quori-possessed leaders
      of the Unity of Riedra. Most Chosen psions have little sentimental
      attachment to their own minds, after all their will is destined to be
      subservient to il altas, the spirits that guide their people. Despite the
      best efforts by the Inspired to restrict the knowledge of crystal shaping,
      teaching it only to trusted Chosen artisans, the kalashtar of Adar
      developed similar practices with a healthier respect for the artificerâ€™s
      own mind. Adaran refugees eventually introduced the practice to Khorvaire,
      though it remains little more than an academic curiosity outside kalashtar
      communities such as Overlook in Sharn.</p>
