      <p>Your growing mastery of magic allows you to better harness the raw
      power you wield. You gain a benefit whenever you cast one of your Giant
      Magic spells, with the benefit depending on your
      ancestry:</p><p><strong>Cloud</strong>. Immediately after casting the
      spell, you can choose to magically teleport to an unoccupied space that
      you can see. You can teleport a number of feet equal to 5 x your
      proficiency bonus.</p><p><strong>Fire</strong>. When you roll for damage
      caused by the spell, you deal additional fire damage equal to your
      Proficiency bonus.</p><p><strong>Frost</strong>. Immediately after casting
      the spell, you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
      If you are in your Titan state, the temporary hit points are additive, but
      cannot exceed the initial number of temporary hit points you gained when
      you entered the state.</p><p><strong>Stone</strong>. Immediately after
      casting the spell, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to your proficiency
      bonus until the start of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Storm</strong>.
      Immediately after casting the spell, you can choose to deal lightning
      damage equal to your proficiency bonus to every creature within 5ft of
      you</p>
