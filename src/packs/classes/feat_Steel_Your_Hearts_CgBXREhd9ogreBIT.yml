    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, your words and actions inspire your companions
      to new heights. Friendly creatures within 60 feet of you that can hear you
      have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened while
      you are conscious.</p><p>In addition, when you use your Second Wind
      feature, choose a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier
      (minimum of one) within 60 feet of you that can hear you. They gain
      temporary hit points equal to the hit points you regain with your Second
      Wind feature. These temporary hit points last until they take a short or
      long rest.</p>
