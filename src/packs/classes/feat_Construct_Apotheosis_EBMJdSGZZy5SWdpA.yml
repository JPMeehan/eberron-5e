    value: >-
      <p>You have modified your form, becoming nearly impervious to the
      weaknesses of flesh. You gain the following benefits: </p><ul><li><p>You
      gain resistance to poison damage and psychic damage, and you are immune to
      the poisoned condition. </p></li><li><p>If you are affected by a spell or
      magical effect, you can choose to consider yourself a construct instead of
      your other creature types. </p></li><li><p>You can cast the <em>antilife
      shell</em> and <em>investiture of stone</em> spells without expending a
      spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without material components,
      provided you use your battlefist as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast
      either spell with this feature, you canâ€™t cast that spell with it again
      until you finish a long rest.</p></li></ul>
