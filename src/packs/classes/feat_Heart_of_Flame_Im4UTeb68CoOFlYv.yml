      <p>You can choose to manifest your rage as searing magical flames to burn
      your foes to ash. You gain resistance to fire damage; additionally, you
      can choose where to channel your flames each time you rage, choosing one
      option from below that lasts until your rage ends:</p><p><strong>Boiling
      Blood</strong>. You seethe with fury, internalizing the fire that burns in
      your veins. Whenever you begin your turn grappled by a creature, or a
      creature begins its turn grappled by you, you can choose for it to take
      fire damage equal to 1d6 + your proficiency bonus. Additionally, whenever
      a creature hits you with an attack while within 5ft of you, they take fire
      damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</p><p><strong>Blazing
      Blows</strong>. You focus your rage outwards, causing your weapons to
      ignite. When you make a melee attack for the first time on your turn,
      every creature of your choice in a 15ft cone originating from you in the
      direction of your attack takes fire damage equal to your proficiency
      bonus</p>
