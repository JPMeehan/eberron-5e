      "value": "<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to force foes to redirect their attacks. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you or casts a spell that targets only you, you can use your reaction to brandish your holy symbol and cause the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your cleric spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must instead target another creature of your choice that is within range of the attack or spell. If there is not another creature within range, this ability fails. You must choose to use this feature before you make a saving throw or know whether the attack against you hits or misses.</p>",
