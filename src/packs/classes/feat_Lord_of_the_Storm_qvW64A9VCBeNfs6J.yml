    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, you have truly mastered the power of the storm. You gain
      immunity to lightning damage, resistance to thunder damage, and you are
      immune to being moved against your will or being knocked prone.</p><p>In
      addition, whenever you are subjected to lightning damage, you take no
      damage and instead gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the
      lightning damage that would have been dealt.</p>
