  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Adamants are warriors who have honed their sense of self into a
      palpable force, fortifying their physical bodies with their diamond will.
      They refine themselves to be faster, stronger, better; realizing their
      potential through psionically mastered ego.</p><p>The monks of Adar first
      developed the martial and mental traditions necessary to become an adamant
      centuries before the arrival of the Kalashtar. Today, the ideal of the
      adamant self has spread across Sarlona, both within the Unity of Riedra
      and to those who oppose it. The Kalashtar and other Adaran immigrants have
      also brought the techniques used to become an adamant with them to
      Khorvaire.</p>
