  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While this mutagen is active, you gain resistance to fire damage, and
      gain advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks. </p><p>When you Action
      Surge or use Second Wind, you gain a charge of infernal fire. When you are
      damaged by a creature you can see within 60 feet of you, you can use your
      reaction and expend a charge to force it to make a Dexterity saving throw.
      On a failure, it takes 2d10 fire damage, or half on a success. You lose
      all charges upon finishing a short or long rest.</p>
