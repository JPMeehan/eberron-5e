    value: >-
      <p>The sheer arcane power flowing through you is so great that your form
      grows even larger when you focus it within your own body. Your Titan State
      improves, gaining the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You grow to size
      Huge, instead of Large.</li><li>Creatures have disadvantage on saving
      throws against your Giant Magic spells, while you have advantage on any
      attack rolls that are part of those spells.</li><li>You cannot be moved
      against your will by other creatures that are a smaller size than you
      unless you allow it.</li><li>When you choose to lose hit points when
      casting a spell, you add your proficiency bonus to the additional force
      damage dealt as a result.</li></ul>
