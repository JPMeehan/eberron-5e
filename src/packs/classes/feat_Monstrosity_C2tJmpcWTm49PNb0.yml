  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While this Mutagen is active, you can add your Constitution modifier to
      Charisma (Intimidation) checks. </p><p>When you Action Surge, you can
      choose to roar with monstrous strength, forcing every creature of your
      choice within 30 feet that you can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw.
      On a failure, a creature is frightened of you, and can repeat the saving
      throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.</p>
