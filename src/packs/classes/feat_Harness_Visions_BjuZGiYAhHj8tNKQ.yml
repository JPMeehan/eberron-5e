    value: >-
      <p>Whenever you sleep during a long rest, roll a d20. On a roll of 2
      through 20, you can decide whether you have dreamlike visions or
      nightmarish ones during your sleep. On a roll of 1, you have a nightmare.
      When you finish a long rest, you can harness your dreams or nightmares,
      turning them into impulses that can instill moments of heroism or dread.
      Depending on which you experienced, you gain one special reaction
      below:</p><p><strong>Dreams</strong>. Whenever a creature you can see
      within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or
      an ability check, you can use your reaction to grant the creature
      advantage on their attack, save, or
      check.</p><p><strong>Nightmares</strong>. Whenever a creature you can see
      within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or
      an ability check, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the
      creatureâ€™s attack, save, or check.</p><p>You can use this reaction a
      number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all
      expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
