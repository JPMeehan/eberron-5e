      <p>At 14th level, your metaphysical journey through the ages brings you to
      the downfall of the demonic rajahs at the hands of the couatl. The
      ultimate sacrifice of the feathered serpents cleansed the surface world
      with silver flames, and you have learned to echo that divine power's birth
      in a righteous blaze. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you
      can use a bonus action to draw on the ancient Silver Flame. While this
      power is active, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>As a reaction
      to being hit by a melee attack, you can deal radiant damage to the
      attacker equal to your sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier (minimum
      1).</li><li>You gain a flight speed of 40 feet.</li><li>You have advantage
      on saving throws made to resist the spells and abilities of
      fiends.</li></ul><p>This silver fire lasts for 1 minute or until you
      dismiss it as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can't use it
      again until you finish a long rest.</p>
