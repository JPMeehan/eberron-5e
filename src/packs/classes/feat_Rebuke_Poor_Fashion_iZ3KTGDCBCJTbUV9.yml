  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As an action, choose any number of creatures within 30 feet of you that
      can hear you. Each creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw
      against your spell save DC or suffer 1d6 psychic damage and have
      disadvantage on attack rolls on their next turn as you lambast their awful
      outfit choices. On a success, they take half damage. Creatures with
      Intelligence of 3 or less are immune, but creatures with truly abysmal
      outfits might have disadvantage on the saving throw at the DMâ€™s
      discretion.</p>
