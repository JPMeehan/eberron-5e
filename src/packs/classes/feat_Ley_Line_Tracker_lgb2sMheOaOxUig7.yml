  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Given your knowledge of the landscape, you can use ley lines as
      conduits to stretch your magic over vast distances when tracking a target,
      granting you the following benefits. </p><p><em><strong>Mark
      Bounty.</strong></em> Whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest, you can
      single out one creature as your bounty. To mark a creature as your bounty,
      you must have seen that creature or possess an object that has been in
      their possession for at least 24 hours. Once on each of your turns you can
      change your bounty to one creature you can see (no action required).
      </p><p><em><strong>Masterful Tracking.</strong></em> Your Ranger spells of
      the Divination school can target your bounty at any distance, even if you
      cannot see them, unless your bounty is protected from Divination spells
      (as with Nondetection) or is on another plane of existence.</p>
