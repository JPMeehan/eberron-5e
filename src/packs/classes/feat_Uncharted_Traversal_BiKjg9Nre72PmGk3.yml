    value: >-
      <p>You gain proficiency with whips and navigatorâ€™s tools. Whips count as a
      monk weapon for you.</p><p> While you have a whip or a 50ft length of rope
      on your person, you can deftly use it to swing and traverse through
      terrain. Before or during a jump, you may add up to 20 feet of horizontal
      distance to your jump by latching on to an overhanging object within reach
      of your whip, requiring no action or ability check to do so. This extra
      distance does not count towards your movement.</p>
