      <p>At 9th level, you can easily read the scars left behind on the hearts
      of others. As an action, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested
      by the Charisma (Deception) check of a creature you can see within 60 feet
      of you. If you succeed, you learn what they hate the most, and what they
      fear the most. You and any ally you share this information with gain
      advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and (Intimidation) checks against that
      creature for the next 24 hours. On a failure, the target becomes immune to
      this ability for the next 24 hours. You can use this ability a number of
      times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses upon
      completing a long rest.</p>
