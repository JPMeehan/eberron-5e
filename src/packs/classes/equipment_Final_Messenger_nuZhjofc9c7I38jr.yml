      <p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires use by a
      warforged)</em></p><p><strong>Requires:</strong> Artificer 6</p><p>A
      <em>final messenger</em> is a tiny homunculus—a delicate winged creature
      designed to facilitate communication between warforged soldiers during the
      Last War.</p><p>If you are a warforged, you can use an action to hold a
      <em>final messenger</em> and integrate it into your body. While it is part
      of your body, the <em>messenger</em> cannot be targeted by any attack. You
      can only have one <em>messenger</em> attached to your body at a
      time.</p><p>A <em>final messenger</em> holds four pieces of data,
      accessible only to the warforged it is attached to:</p><ul><li><p>A
      destination for the messenger. This can be very specific (a particular
      apartment in Sharn) or more general (an open
      marketplace).</p></li><li><p>A target individual. This could be a specific
      person or a category (“Any Karrnathi warforged”).</p></li><li><p>A single
      image recorded through the eyes of a warforged attached to the
      messenger.</p></li><li><p>A message of up to 25
      words.</p></li></ul><p>While the <em>messenger</em> is attached to you,
      you can use an action to review the data currently stored within the final
      messenger, and if you choose, to change any or all of these data points.
      You can release the <em>final messenger</em> as a bonus action, at which
      point it flies to its destination by the most direct route possible. Once
      it reaches the destination it seeks the target individual; if no target
      has been set, it approaches the nearest warforged.</p><p>If you are
      reduced to 0 hit points while a final messenger is attached to you, it
      immediately detaches and seek out its target. It retains its stored
      message, but replaces its stored image with the last thing you saw before
      dropping to zero hit points.</p><p>A <em>final messenger</em> is a Tiny
      construct with an AC of 20, 6 hit points, and a flying speed of 60 feet.
      It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions other
      than unconsciousness. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving
      throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). It has darkvision with a
      range of 60 feet. It has no limbs and the only action it can take on its
      turn is the Dash action. A messenger can only remain active for 8 hours
      after it detaches from a warforged body, after which time its energy
      dissipates and it falls unconscious. An unconscious <em>messenger</em>
      must complete a short or long rest attached to a warforged, after which it
      regains its energy, as well as regaining all lost hit points.</p>
