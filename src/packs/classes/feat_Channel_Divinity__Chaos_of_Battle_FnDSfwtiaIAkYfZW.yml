      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to force foes
      to redirect their attacks. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of
      you makes an attack roll against you or casts a spell that targets only
      you, you can use your reaction to brandish your holy symbol and cause the
      creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your cleric spell save DC.
      On a failed save, the creature must instead target another creature of
      your choice that is within range of the attack or spell. If there is not
      another creature within range, this ability fails. You must choose to use
      this feature before you make a saving throw or know whether the attack
      against you hits or misses.</p>
