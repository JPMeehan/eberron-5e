      <p>You ask the Six for their guidance and protection when you take
      advantage of an opening, no matter how dishonorable another Vassal might
      consider it. When you hit a creature with an attack on your turn, you can
      use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to cast one of your
      Dark Petitioner cantrips, regardless of its normal casting time.</p>
