    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you can spend 4 ki points to exhale a blast of fiery
      breath in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity
      saving throw, taking 5d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one. You can use this feature once, and you must
      finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.</p><p> As you grow
      stronger, you can spend additional ki points when you use this feature to
      increase its damage. Each additional ki point you spend increases the
      feature's damage by 1d10. The maximum number of ki points (5 plus any
      additional points) that you can spend on the feature equals half your monk
      level</p>
