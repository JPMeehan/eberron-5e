    value: >-
      <p>When you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you can spend 1 ki
      point to assail it with fear, causing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On
      a failed save, it takes 1d6 points of psychic damage and becomes
      frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If a creature succeeds
      on this save, they are immune to the fear effect of this ability for 24
      hours.</p>
