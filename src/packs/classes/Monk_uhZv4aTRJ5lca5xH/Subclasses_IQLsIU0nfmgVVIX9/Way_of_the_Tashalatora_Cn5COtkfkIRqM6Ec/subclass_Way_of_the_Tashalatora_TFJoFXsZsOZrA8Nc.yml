      <p>The Way of the Tashalatora teaches that mind and body must be aligned
      and honed as one to truly ascend. Paragons of psionic power, they have
      learned not only to touch the minds of others, but to alter the flow of
      time itself.</p><p>The vast majority of adherents of this Way come from
      the Adaran mountain-fortresses that guard the passages into Adar from
      Riedra. In Khorvaire, the kalashtar and Adarans might rarely teach a
      chosen outsider this art; those first-generation students have started to
      teach as well, and are rather less selective with who they accept as
      students.</p><p>Certain undead and aberrant creatures also have a loose
      association with time and space, and although they can serve as an
      alternative source of the powers of a Tashalatora, it's rare to find a
      dolgaunt that's willing to take on a non-aberrant student, let alone to
      allow them survive the encounter. </p>
