    value: >-
      <p>Your connection to the couatl has grown more powerful. You can use a
      bonus action to manifest a pair of iridescent rainbow-feathered wings from
      your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed equal to
      your walking speed. The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or
      you dismiss them as a bonus action.</p><p>In addition, when you make an
      unarmed strike with Flurry of Blows, you can use Psionic Strike with that
      strike without spending the ki point for Psionic Strike. You can still use
      Psionic Strike only once per turn</p>
