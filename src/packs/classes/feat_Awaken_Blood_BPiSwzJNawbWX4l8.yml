    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, you can bestow momentary consciousness on a foe's blood,
      turning it into a weapon against them. As an action, make a melee spell
      attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the creature's speed
      drops to 0 until the end of its next turn and you deal 8d10 points of
      necrotic damage to it. This feature has no effect on constructs,
      elementals, plants, and undead.</p><p>If you reduce a creature to 0 hit
      points with this feature, it dies instantly and its blood pools into a
      blood elemental that is under your mental control for 1 minute or until
      your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell), after which it
      collapses into a puddle, inert. If you were already concentrating on a
      spell, you can choose for the blood to remain unanimated after the
      creature dies, rather than lose concentration on the previous
      spell.</p><p>The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the
      duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It
      obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by
      you). If you don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself
      from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.</p><p>Once you use
      this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
