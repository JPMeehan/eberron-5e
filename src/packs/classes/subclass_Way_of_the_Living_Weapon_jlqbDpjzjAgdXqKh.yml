      <p>A monk following the Way of the Living Weapon pursues physical
      perfection, honing their body as a smith sharpens a sword. Its traditions
      are drawn from cultures of shapeshifters and creatures who fight with
      tooth and claw. These are a few of the martial techniques that have
      evolved into the Way of the Living Weapon.</p><ul><li><p>The Forged Heart
      is a recent path, developed by warforged exploring the potential of their
      constructed frames. This involves both the physical evolution of the body
      and harnessing the strength of steel and stone.</p></li><li><p>The
      Nightmare Shroud is a kalashtar tradition. Rather than physically
      transforming, nightmare monks generate ectoplasmic projections,
      manifesting claws of shadow. Blending physical blows with psychic attacks,
      they strike fear into the mind of their enemies. A kalashtar typically
      surrounds themselves with the image of their quori spirit, but the shroud
      can take any shape.</p></li><li><p>The Traveler’s Blade was developed by
      tribal changelings, providing the practitioner with versatile weapons that
      can’t be taken away. A practitioner can grow bone blades or knuckle
      ridges, or stretch their limbs to strike a distant foe.</p></li><li><p>The
      Weretouched techniques were developed by shifter champions of Olarune,
      honing the natural weapons and strengths of the shifter</p></li></ul>
