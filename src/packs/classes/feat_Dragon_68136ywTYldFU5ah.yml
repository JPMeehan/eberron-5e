      <p>While this mutagen is active, you have advantage on saving throws made
      to resist being frightened, and your AC increases by 1. </p><p>When you
      Action surge or use Second Wind, you can breathe out your choice of fire,
      lightning, or freezing cold in a 15ft cone in front of you. Every creature
      within the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6
      damage of the chosen type, or half on a success.</p>
