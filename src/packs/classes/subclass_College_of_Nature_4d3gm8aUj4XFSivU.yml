      <p>Since the dawn of time, the whistling wind, rushing rivers and calls of
      birds have inspired countless works of art. Some bards see beauty in the
      world around us, acting as emissaries to the powers of nature, and working
      with the land as their canvas. The College of Nature is less an
      organization than an ideal - to protect the wonder of the wild, and find
      joy in its splendor. Their commitment to harmony allows them to speak to
      animals, plants, and even elementals. When nature comes under attack, they
      call on those powers to protect it - and can unleash devastating natural
      disasters in defense.</p><p> Bards of the College of Nature might use any
      instrument, from paints, to flutes, to dance - anything that allows them
      to attune to the rhythms of the world. In Xen’drik, the Vulkoor, Qaltiar,
      and Na’qalla drow venerate and call upon the spirits of nature, while the
      Rimewalker druids of the Iceflow often speak with the giant animals of
      their home. In Khorvaire, the Greensingers of the Reaches combine druidic
      and bardic traditions to treat with the fey, while the gnomes of Lorghalan
      survive through their close friendship with elementals</p>
