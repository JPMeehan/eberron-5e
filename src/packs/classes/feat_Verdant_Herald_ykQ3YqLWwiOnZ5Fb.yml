    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you can cast the spell awaken without expending a spell
      slot or requiring material components, targeting a plant with either no
      Intelligence score, or an Intelligence of 3 or less. While you are within
      300 feet of a plant that has been awakened by you, both you and the plant
      can communicate telepathically with each other. Once you cast the spell in
      this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
