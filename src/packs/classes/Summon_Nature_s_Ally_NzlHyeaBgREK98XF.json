      "value": "<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon an ally from the world around you, rather than assuming a beast form. As an action, you cause local flora to combine with sand, dirt, and rock to take the form of any beast of your choice that your Wild Shape feature would allow you to transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table of that feature. This summoned ally has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is an elemental instead of a beast. It appears within an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you, and disappears after 10 minutes or when it drops to 0 hit points.</p><p>Your summoned ally can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action.</p><p>You can only have one summoned ally at a time. If you summon an additional one, the first one that you summoned crumbles into its component parts, inert.</p><p>In addition, any spells that you cast that can affect beasts can affect your summoned ally as well, as if it were a beast.</p>",
