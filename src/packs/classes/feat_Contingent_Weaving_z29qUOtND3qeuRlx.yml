    value: >-
      <p>By 15th level, you've mastered the art of storing powerful spell
      effects in your tapestry where they wait for your signal, the bound magic
      warding your allies. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>All of
      the creatures in your tapestry have advantage on saves against spells and
      magical effects while within 60 feet of you. You must be conscious to
      grant this bonus.</li><li>Once per long rest, you can cast contingency
      with this feature without expending a spell slot, without preparing the
      spell, and without a material component, provided you use weaver's tools
      as the spellcasting focus. When you do so, you can choose for any creature
      in your eldritch tapestry to count as you for purposes of determining the
      target of the contingent spell; you do not have to specify which creature
      it is when you cast it. For example, you could cast feather fall as your
      contingent spell, and set it to take effect on the first creature in your
      tapestry that falls more than 20 feet in one round. If more than one
      creature simultaneously meets the criteria to trigger the circumstance you
      described, you choose at the time the spell would go into effect which one
      creature it affects.</li><li>When you cast the contingency spell multiple
      times, you can have several contingencies active at a time, up to a number
      equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).</li></ul>
