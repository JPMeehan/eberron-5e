    value: >-
      <p>At 7th level, your specialized training has made you better at
      protecting yourself, and your companions, from psionic attacks. You
      permanently gain resistance to your choice of psychic or force damage,
      advantage on saving throws against possession, and your thoughts can’t be
      magically read. As an action, you can temporarily extend this benefit to a
      number of other creatures equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier for the next
      ten minutes. Once you have done this, you can’t do so again until you take
      a short or long rest.</p>
