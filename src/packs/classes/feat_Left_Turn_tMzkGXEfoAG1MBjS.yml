    value: >-
      <p>When using your Distracting Strut, you can expend a Bardic Inspiration
      die and choose one of the following effects in addition to the normal
      effects of Distracting Strut: </p><ul><li><p>Allies that can see you
      regain 4d10 HP. </p></li><li><p>Creatures affected by Distracting Strut
      must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed
      save a creature takes radiant damage equal to the result of a roll of your
      Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency
      modifier and are blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature
      takes half as much damage and is not blinded. A creature blinded by your
      Distracting Strut can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
      turns, ending the condition on a success. </p></li><li><p>Your movement
      does not provoke opportunity attacks until the end of your
      turn.</p></li></ul>
