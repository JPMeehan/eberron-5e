  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you release a wave of caustic energy to repel incoming
      attacks. As a reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see,
      you can force that creature to make a Constitution saving throw against
      your spell save DC. On a fail, that creature takes a number of d6â€™s of
      acid damage equal to your Charisma modifier. You can use this feature a
      number of times equal to your Charisma modifier per long rest.</p>
