    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 10th level, your ability to move and fight with your
      summoned ally is enhanced by your connection to the Dragon Between. When
      you use your Summon Nature's Ally feature, you gain the following benefits
      until your summoned ally disappears:</p><ul><li>Your summoned ally
      automatically succeeds on its saving throws against your druid spells, and
      it is immune to all damage dealt by druid spells you cast.</li><li>Your
      summoned ally's attacks count as magical weapons.</li><li>While your
      summoned ally is within 30 feet of you, you both have advantage on saves
      against being charmed or frightened.</li></ul>
