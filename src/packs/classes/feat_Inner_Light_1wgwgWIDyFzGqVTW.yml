    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, your inner light shines brightly in the
      darkness. You gain proficiency with the longbow, and you learn the light
      cantrip, which you can cast as a bonus action with a casting range of 60
      feet instead of touch only. Your spellcasting ability modifier for this
      spell is Charisma.</p><p>You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak
      Attack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak
      Attack against a creature if it is in bright light shed by a spell you
      cast, as long as you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the
      other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.</p>
