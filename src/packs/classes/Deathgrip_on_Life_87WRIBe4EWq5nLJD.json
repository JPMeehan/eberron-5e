      "value": "<p>Your unexpected return to life gives new understanding of blood's power. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. You also stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn.</p><p>Additionally, you are never left without your source of power. As a bonus action, you can allow your blood to seep out of your hands, dealing 1 point of damage to yourself. For the next minute, your blood itself can act as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p><p>Damage done to yourself with this feature can't be prevented or reduced in any way, and doesn't cause a Constitution save to maintain concentration on a spell.</p>",
