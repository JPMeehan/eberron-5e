    value: >-
      <p>Your wandplay is legendary, and your territory is assured. Whenever you
      expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration or when a creature within 60 feet
      of you adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to a D20 Test, one
      creature of your choice that can see you within 60 feet of yourself must
      make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save,
      the target has the Frightened condition until the end of its next turn. If
      the target already has the Frightened condition, it must immediately use
      its Reaction, if available, to move as far as away from you as it can,
      using the safest route.</p>
