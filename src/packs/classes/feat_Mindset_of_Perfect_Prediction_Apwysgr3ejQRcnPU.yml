      <p>You have learned to enter a focused state of mind. As an Action, you
      can activate your mindset of perfect prediction, gaining the benefits
      below. At the end of each of your turns, starting on the turn after you
      activated your mindset, you must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 plus
      your Charisma modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, your
      mindset ends. If you are concentrating on multiple spells when your
      mindset ends, you can choose one spell to maintain. The rest of the spells
      end as if your Concentration had been broken. Once you use this feature,
      you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><em><strong>Quickened Mind.</strong></em> When rolling
      Initiative, you may instead choose an Initiative count of
      31.</p><p><em><strong>Expansive Mind.</strong></em> You can concentrate on
      any number of spells simultaneously. If you are forced to make a saving
      throw to maintain Concentration while you are concentrating on multiple
      spells, you make only a single Constitution saving throw. On a failed
      save, your Concentration breaks on all
      spells.</p><p><em><strong>Predictive Mind.</strong></em> You have
      Counterspell prepared. You can cast it as a 6th-level spell without
      expending a spell slot. </p>
