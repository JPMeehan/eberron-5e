  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You gain the ability to control the actions of Petrified creatures,
      while bestowing upon them the power of your patron. One creature with the
      Petrified condition that you touch becomes an Earth Elemental Spirit under
      your control as if you had cast the Summon Elemental spell at 6th-level.
      The creature's size does not change and you do not need to maintain
      Concentration. The transformation lasts until a Greater Restoration spell
      is cast on the creature, until the Elemental Spirit is reduced to 0 Hit
      Points, or until you use this feature again.</p>
