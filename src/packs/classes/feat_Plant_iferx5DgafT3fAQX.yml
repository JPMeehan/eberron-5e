      <p>While this Mutagen is active, you have resistance to poison damage.
      Additionally, you gain the ability to communicate in a limited manner with
      plants and vegetation. They can understand the meaning of your words,
      though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have
      advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them. </p><p>When
      you use your Second Wind or Action Surge, you gain a bonus to your AC
      equal to your proficiency bonus until the start of your next turn.</p>
