    value: >-
      <p>While this mutagen is active, you have resistance to psychic damage,
      and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes
      the same amount of damage that you do.</p><p> When you Action Surge or use
      Second Wind, your reach cumulatively increases by 5 feet as your anatomy
      becomes pliable and warped. This lasts until you next complete a short or
      long rest</p>
