      <p>Weather is a primal source of power, and no weather is more iconic than
      that of the howling winds of a tornado, the thunderous rebuke of a
      thunderstorm, or the torrential rainfall of a hurricane. While some
      sorcerers claim to harness the power of the storm, you know this to be a
      lie. The storm cannot be tamedâ€”it is merely ridden and guided by a wise
      hand. You know the lullabies that can call and soothe the storms, and the
      anthems that summon a mighty tempest to take away the breath of those who
      deny its power.</p><p>Adepts of the Devourer are by far the most common
      practitioners of this circle, especially sahuagin and privateers. House
      Lyrandar's dragonmarked heirs often can manifest these powers, as do some
      humans of the Seren Islands. However, any sailor who lives on the seas and
      has sufficient respect for the Storm might learn to channel these
      abilities.</p><p>Though the nomads of the Tashana Tundra have little
      familiarity with the sea, their unique relationship with planar powers
      means that druids of the Storm are not unknown there. </p>
