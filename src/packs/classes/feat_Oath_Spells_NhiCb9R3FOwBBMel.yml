      <p>When you take this oath, choose the following class that best
      represents your venerated ancestor: artificer, bard, cleric, druid,
      ranger, sorcerer, warlock, wizard. When you gain this feature, choose one
      1st-level spell from your ancestor’s class spell list. That spell is an
      oath spell for you. When you reach certain levels in this class— 5th
      level, 9th level, 13th level, and 17th level—you gain another oath spell
      of your choice from your ancestor’s class spell list. When you gain a
      paladin level, you can choose one of these spells and replace it with
      another spell from your ancestor’s class spell list. See the Sacred Oath
      class feature for how oath spells work.</p><p>Additionally, you add the
      <em>enhance ability</em>, <em>find steed</em>, and <em>find greater
      steed</em> spells to your oath spells.</p>
