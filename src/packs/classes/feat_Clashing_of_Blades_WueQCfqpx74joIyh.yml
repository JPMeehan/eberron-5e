      <p>Starting at 15th level, you can bolster your allies to strike out at
      their foes with renewed vigor. When a creature within 60 feet of you that
      can hear you takes the Attack action, you can use your reaction to grant
      it one additional attack as part of that action. At 20th level, you grant
      creatures two additional attacks, instead of one, when you use this
      feature.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
      Charisma modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of
      it when you finish a long rest.</p>
