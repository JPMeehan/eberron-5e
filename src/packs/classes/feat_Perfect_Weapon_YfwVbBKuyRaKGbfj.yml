      <p>At 15th level, you learn how to imbue your ghaal’shaarat with
      additional power, and how to draw on it in time of need. The first time
      you attack with your ghaal’shaarat on your turn, you can transfer some or
      all of its bonus to your armor class, instead of using the bonus on any
      attacks that turn. For every 1 you reduce your attack and damage rolls by,
      you gain +1 to your AC. As long as you continue holding your
      ghaal’shaarat, the AC bonus remains in effect until the start of your next
      turn. </p><p>Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can select one
      of the following benefits. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain
      the selected benefit whenever you’re holding your ghaal’shaarat.
      </p><ul><li><p>You have resistance to psychic damage, and you can’t be
      charmed or frightened. </p></li><li><p>You use your ghaal’shaarat to
      channel the elements. When you select this ability, select one of the
      following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. When you
      hit with your ghaal’shaarat, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the
      chosen type.</p></li></ul>
