    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, you blur the lines between life energy and
      magical power. You can use your bonus action to deal damage to yourself
      and store it up as temporary sorcery points that must be spent on a
      Metamagic option before the end of your turn. For every 1d6 damage you
      deal to yourself in this way, you gain 1 temporary sorcery
      point.</p><p>Damage done to yourself with this feature can't be prevented
      or reduced in any way, and doesn't cause a Constitution save to maintain
      concentration on a spell.</p>
