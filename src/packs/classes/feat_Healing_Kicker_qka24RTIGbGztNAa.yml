    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, you deepen your knowledge of healing techniques. When
      you cast a spell that restores hit points to another creature, every
      target of that spell gains one of the following benefits of your
      choice:</p><h5> Great Fortitude</h5> <p>The target gains advantage on the
      next Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity saving throw that it makes
      within the next minute.</p><h5> Iron Will</h5> <p>The target gains
      advantage on the next Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma saving throw that
      it makes within the next minute.</p><h5> Lightning Reflexes</h5> <p>The
      next time the target is subjected to an effect that does damage within the
      next minute, it can use its reaction to halve the damage from that
      effect.</p><h5> Power Attack</h5> <p>The target has advantage on all
      attack rolls until the end of its next turn.</p><p>If multiple creatures
      are healed by the same spell, the chosen effect applies to all of
      them.</p>
