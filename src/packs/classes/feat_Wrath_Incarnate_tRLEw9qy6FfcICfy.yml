    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you become an embodiment of divine fury - an indomitable
      warrior that strikes fear into the hearts of evil, your own filled with
      burning piety. Once per long rest as a bonus action, you can enter a state
      of incandescent rage, by channeling the divinity of your faith. While in
      this state, you cannot be reduced below 1 hit point by any means, and can
      take the Dash action as a bonus action.</p><p>Additionally, you regain a
      1st level spell slot whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points. At the
      start of your turn, the state ends if you have not made an attack against
      an enemy since the start of your last turn. You can maintain this state
      for a maximum of 1 minute.</p>
