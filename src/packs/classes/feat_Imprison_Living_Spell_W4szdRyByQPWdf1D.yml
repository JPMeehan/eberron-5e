      <p>At 14th level, you learn the secrets of creating an unstable living
      spell and capturing it in a Khyber dragonshard, preserving its magical
      energy and allowing you to cast the spell that it's composed
      from.</p><p>When you complete a long rest, you can touch a Khyber
      dragonshard worth at least 250 gp that does not already have another
      creature bound inside it, choosing one spell of up to 5th level from your
      spellbook that has a casting time of 1 action and that requires no costly
      material components. When you do so, you capture that spell in the form of
      a living spell in the dragonshard without expending a spell slot or
      requiring material components.</p><p>When you are holding the dragonshard,
      you can use an action to expend a charge from it and cast the spell at its
      lowest level, requiring no verbal or material components. The spell level
      of the living spell you capture determines the number of charges the
      dragonshard has, as shown on the Captured Living Spell table. These
      charges last until expended or until you finish a long rest, after which
      time the magic of the living spell dissipates.</p><p>Additionally, if you
      encounter a living spell in the wild that is within 30 feet of you, and
      you have a Khyber dragonshard worth at least 250 gp that does not already
      have another creature bound inside it, you can use an action to cause the
      wild living spell to make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard
      spell save DC. On a failed save, the wild living spell is imprisoned
      within the dragonshard, and the dragonshard gains a number of charges as
      shown on the Captured Living Spell table. Once you have imprisoned a wild
      living spell, you can expend charges to cast the spell that it is made of,
      following the same rules for a living spell you captured in a dragonshard
      using this feature.</p><table><caption>Captured Living
