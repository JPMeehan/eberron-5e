      <p>An allied character wearing or carrying an item that you have infused
      can choose to gain a bonus to a single ability check, attack roll or
      saving throw equal to the number of allies they can see or hear who are
      also wearing or carrying items infused by you. A character can use this
      feature once, and they regain the ability to do so when they finish a long
      rest.</p><p>Additionally, you can cast the spell holy weapon without
      expending a spell slot on a weapon you have infused. You can cast the
      spell in this way once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a
      long rest.</p>
