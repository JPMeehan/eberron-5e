    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you are skilled in maintaining control of
      yourself while allowing spiritual entities to inhabit you. You are immune
      to unwanted possession.</p><p>Additionally, if a creature attempts to
      possess you against your will, you can use your reaction to cause it to
      make a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC. On a failed save, it
      becomes trapped inside you, is incapacitated, and cannot control you or
      escape on its own. When you use this feature, you lose the benefits of the
      spirit that previously inhabited you through your Spiritual Channel
      feature, and instead gain the benefits of the invading spirit's type. The
      DM will choose a spirit type from your Spiritual Channel ability that best
      matches the spirit you have trapped.</p><p>When you trap a creature in
      this way, it cannot escape until you choose to release it as an action or
      you use your Spiritual Channel ability to call a different spirit type to
      inhabit you. When you do so, it is banished to its home plane. If the
      creature is native to the plane of existence you're on, you banish it to a
      harmless demiplane for 1 hour; while there, the creature is incapacitated,
      and after 1 hour, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest
      unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p>
