      <p>You learn the gust cantrip if you do not already know it, and can cast
      it without requiring components.</p><p> You also learn an additional spell
      of 1st level or higher when you reach certain levels in this class, as
      shown in the Wind Runner Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell
      for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you
      know.</p>
