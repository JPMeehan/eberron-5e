  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>Tip the Scales of Fate with Divine Gold</em> </p><p>Prayer may be
      the currency of the gods, but hard cash makes the world go round. Clerics
      of the Commerce Domain believe that society and economy are two sides of
      the same coin, and defending one’s community means little if you don’t
      have the resources and trade to back it up. As the Sovereign of World and
      Wealth, Kol Korran is the most common patron to Clerics of this domain,
      but those with a more selfish outlook might look to the Keeper to support
      their greed.</p>
