      <p><strong>Requires:</strong> Artificer 6</p><p>Gloves of storing come in
      pairs, each one tied to a small pocket dimension. While wearing the gloves
      and holding an object that weighs no more than 20 pounds and can be held
      in one hand, you can use a bonus action to store that object inside the
      glove’s extradimensional space. When an object is stored inside the
      extradimensional space, you can use a bonus action to summon it back into
      your empty hand. You can only store a single object in each glove’s
      extradimensional space, for a total of two items between the
      pair.</p><p>The gloves’ weight is negligible, regardless of their
      contents. If a glove is pierced or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and
      the object it was storing is lost in the Astral Plane.</p><p>Placing
      <em>gloves of storing</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a
      <em>bag of holding</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item instantly
      destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate
      originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature
      within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on
      the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t
      be reopened.</p>
