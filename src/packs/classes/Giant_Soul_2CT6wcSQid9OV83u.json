      "value": "<p>The ancient giants channeled the power of the planes to become sorcerers, growing in size in proportion to their arcane power. You have inherited this overflowing power, or bound it within you using ancient Xenâ€™drik arcana. Unleashed, you can grow into a true titan, hurling the destructive power of the elements at your foes - but such power comes with a price.</p><p> As a Giant Soul sorcerer, you decide how you have inherited your powers, and how it manifests upon you. You must also decide how to wield it - as a whirlwind of barely-contained power, or as a towering herald of order. The giants of the Battalion of Basalt Towers seek to wield their primordial fire to conquer and destroy, while the Zephyr Guard of Kul Lerek harness the winds in defense of their home.</p>",
