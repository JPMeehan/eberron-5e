    value: >-
      <p>At 15th level, your very presence is enough to bolster your allies with
      a sense of unshakeable calm in battle. As long as you aren’t
      incapacitated, you and your allies within ten feet of you gain a +1 bonus
      to all saving throws, and can’t be charmed or frightened</p>
