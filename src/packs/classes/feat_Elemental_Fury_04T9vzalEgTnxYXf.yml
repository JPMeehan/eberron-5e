      <p>Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to imbue your attacks with
      elemental damageâ€”charging your claws with electricity or unleashing flames
      from your fangs. When you use Wild Shape, choose one of the following
      damage types: acid, cold, fire, or lightning. While in your beast form,
      the first time you hit a creature with a melee attack on your turn, you
      can expend one spell slot to deal extra damage of that type to the target,
      in addition to the normal damage of the attack. The extra damage is 1d6
      per level of the spell slot expended, to a maximum of 5d6.</p><p>When you
      use this ability on a creature, your attack has an additional effect,
      determined by which damage type you selected when you used Wild Shape. If
      a creature is affected by this ability again in subsequent rounds, the
      effects do not stack, and the new duration replaces the
      old.</p><p><em><strong>Acid.</strong></em> The target must make a
      Constitution saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed
      save, its AC is reduced for one minute by an amount equal to half your
      Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). At the start of each of its turns for the
      next minute, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a
      successful save, the effect ends.</p><p><em><strong>Cold.</strong></em> At
      the start of each of its turns for 1 minute, the target must make a
      Constitution saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed
      save, their movement speed is reduced to 0 and they have disadvantage on
      Strength and Dexterity checks. On a successful save, the effect
      ends.</p><p><em><strong>Fire.</strong></em> At the start of each of its
      turns for 1 minute, the target must make a Constitution saving throw
      against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes [[/damage
      @abilities.wis.mod fire]] damage. On a successful save, the fire goes out.
      If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out
      the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target
      being submerged in water), the effect
      ends.</p><p><em><strong>Lightning.</strong></em> At the start of each of
      its turns for 1 minute, the target must make a Constitution saving throw
      against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, it loses its reaction
      until the start of its next turn and the first attack that it makes on its
      turn is made at disadvantage. On a successful save, the effect ends.</p>
