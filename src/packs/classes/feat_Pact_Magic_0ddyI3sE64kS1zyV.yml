      <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you tap into a source
      of raw and chaotic magic that gifts you with arcane abilities. You gain
      the ability to cast spells; see chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for
      the general rules of spellcasting and the warlock spell list.</p><h5>
      Cantrips</h5> <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock
      spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip at 10th level. These
      are considered Rage Mage spells for you.</p><h5> Spell Slots</h5> <p>The
      Rage Mage Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
      your Rage Mage spells. The table also shows what the level of those slots
      is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your Rage
      Mage spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You
      regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For
      example, when you are 7th level, you have two 2nd level spell slots. To
      cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots,
      and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p><h5> Spells Known of 1st Level
      and Higher</h5> <p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your
      choice from the warlock spell list. Any spell you learn through this class
      feature is considered a Rage Mage spell for you.</p><p>The Spells Known
      column of the Rage Mage table shows when you learn more spells of your
      choice of 1st level or higher from the warlock spell list. A spell you
      choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot
      Level column for your level. When you reach 7th level, for example, you
      learn a new spell from the warlock spell list, which can be 1st or 2nd
      level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
      choose one of the Rage Mage spells you know and replace it with another
      spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which
      you have spell slots.</p><h5> Spellcasting Focus</h5> <p>You can use a
      martial weapon as a spellcasting focus for your Rage Mage spells.</p><h5>
      Spellcasting Ability</h5> <p>Constitution is your spellcasting ability for
      your Rage Mage spells, so you use your Constitution whenever a spell
      refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
      Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Rage Mage
      spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p></p><b>Spell
      save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution
      modifier<p></p><p></p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency
      bonus + your Constitution modifier<p></p>
