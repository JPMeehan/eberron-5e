  description:
    value: >-
      <p>While this Mutagen is active, you have resistance to necrotic damage,
      and advantage on Constitution saving throws. </p><p>When you are reduced
      to 0 hit points, if you are unconscious at the start of your turn, you
      regain a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. This
      counts as using your Second Wind ability for the effects of your other
      Mutagens. This effect only triggers the first time you begin your turn
      unconscious; once used, you regain this ability upon finishing a long
      rest.</p>
