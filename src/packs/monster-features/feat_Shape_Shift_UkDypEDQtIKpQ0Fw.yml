  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The demonglass warrior shape-shifts into the form of a Fiend. Any
      equipment they are wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new
      form (their choice). The host’s statistics and capabilities—including
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—are replaced by those of the new form.
      This effect lasts for 1 minute or until the host is reduced to 0 Hit
      Points. An exceptionally powerful warrior might be able to maintain the
      effect for a longer time. When the transformation ends, the host reverts
      to their previous form, with the same Hit Points they had before the
      transformation. However, if they revert as a result of dropping to 0 Hit
      Points, any excess damage carries over to the new form. For example, if
      the host takes 10 damage in Fiend form and only has 1 Hit Point left, they
      revert and take 9 damage.</p>
