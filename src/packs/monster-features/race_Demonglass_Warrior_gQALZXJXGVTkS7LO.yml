      <p>The demonglass found on the Western Frontier is the solidified essence
      of the overlord Tol Kharash and his lesser fiends. Cults of the Horned
      King—notably, the denizens of Turakbar’s Fist—often embed small shards of
      demonglass within the cult's warriors. This serves as a minor form of
      possession, compelling the warriors to serve the Horned King while
      simultaneously weakening their ability to resist his fiendish minions. The
      basic abilities granted by embedded demonglass are presented in the
      Demonglass Warrior template, while other potential powers are described in
      the Demonglass Champion sidebar. Removing an embedded demonglass shard
      from a creature is a risky proposition, typically killing the
      host.</p><p>Removing a shard safely requires the host to either be a
      willing participant, Restrained, or Unconscious. A Remove Curse or Greater
      Restoration spell cast on the host breaks the possession and allows the
      shard to be removed. The actual physical removal requires a sharp tool and
      a [[/check wis med 15]] check; if the check fails, the shard is still
      removed, but the host suffers 15 points of Piercing damage</p>
