  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a malenti, you’ve assumed the identity and memories of a dryskin,
      and this provides you with the benefits of their position. Choose one of
      the following background features: By Popular Demand (entertainer),
      Criminal Contact (criminal), Military Rank (soldier), Position of
      Privilege (noble), or Shelter of the Faithful (acolyte). Once made, you
      cannot change this choice. This is who you are now, and the background
      feature suggests what people will expect of you. If you have Shelter of
      the Faithful, it’s because you’ve taken the place of an acolyte, and
      people of your assumed faith expect you to live up to that role.</p>
