      <p>Whether you were indoctrinated into it, or joined later in life in a
      moment of desperation, you were once a member of one of the many Sundered
      Heart cults scattered across Syrkarn. However, you eventually saw through
      the cult’s lies, and chose instead to strike out on your own as an
      adventurer. Thanks to your time on the inside, you’re more adept than the
      average person at picking up on the common patterns that unite Syrkarn’s
      disjointed worshippers — and though thinking back on those memories haunts
      you, perhaps you hold the common thread that could unravel the Sundered
      Heart’s entire dominion.</p>
