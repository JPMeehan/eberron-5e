      <p>Most foreigners see Riedra as a paradise where no one knows fear or
      hunger or suffering. Not you, however. You know exactly what kind of
      darkness lurks behind the Unity’s veneer of perfection and peace, because
      you’ve experienced more than your fair share of abuse and indoctrination
      at the hands of the Dreaming Dark. Whether you grew disillusioned due to
      your low caste on the Path of Inspiration, defied the orders of the
      Inspired, or simply broke down and decided you couldn’t live this way
      anymore, you chose to attempt the unthinkable: escaping from Riedra’s
      clutches.</p><p>Somehow — whether with the assistance of the Summit Road
      or one of the other dissident factions, your own skill, or just sheer luck
      — you actually managed to pull it off. Syrkarn is your new home now, and
      the dizzying freedom is a far cry from the sheltered way of life you’ve
      always known. Still, though the threat of the Thousand Eyes’ gaze
      continues to linger in the back of your mind, your thoughts are truly your
      own for the first time ever — giving you a privilege you never could have
      dreamed of: the chance to choose your own path in life.</p>
