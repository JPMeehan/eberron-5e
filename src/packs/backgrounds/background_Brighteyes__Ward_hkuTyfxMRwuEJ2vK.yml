      <p>The brass greatwyrm Qataakhast is widely thought to be nothing more
      than a local legend, thanks to the tireless efforts of his overly
      possessive apprentice. However, you know more than most people how real
      the myths are: either you were raised by the dragon, or you spent long
      enough in his lair that he considers you a member of the family he wishes
      he had. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and you
      eventually grew up to realize you couldn’t spend the rest of your life
      holed up in his cave — no matter how comfortable you may be, and how much
      he may enjoy the company.</p><p>Despite being away, you still carry a
      piece of your old guardian’s legacy with you. Many of Qataakhast’s wards
      inherit some of his draconic magic, and some even grow brass scales or
      display an affinity for fire magic thanks to his influence. No matter how
      far you wander, you know you’ll always be welcomed back home: though the
      dragon has taken in countless humanoids over the centuries, he remembers
      each one by name, and loves them all like the children he never had.</p>
