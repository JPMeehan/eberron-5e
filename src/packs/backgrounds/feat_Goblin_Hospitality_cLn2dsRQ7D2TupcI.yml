  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Over the last few decades, the Khesh’dar have established safe houses
      and agents in many of the major cities of Khorvaire. In addition, many
      modern goblins are keen to hear tales of ancient Dhakaan and are happy to
      trade a meal for a story or song. You can find a place to hide, rest, or
      recuperate in any sizable community of goblins. They’ll shield you from
      the law or anyone else searching for you, though they won’t risk their
      lives for you.</p>
