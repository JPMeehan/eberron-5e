      <p>As a traveler, you have learned a secret language that allows you to
      silently convey messages to fellow changelings. This is an exotic language
      that can only be “spoken” by changelings, though members of other species
      can learn to understand it. Skin cant uses shifting patterns of scars,
      tattoos, and pigment. This allows you to convey a short message—a concept
      that can be expressed in six words or less—to anyone who knows the
      language and who can see you. Typically the message is something you
      maintain as part of your appearance; for example, in crafting your image,
      you might add a pattern of scars that tells other changeling travelers, “I
      need help” or “Everything I say is a lie.”</p><p>You can also use this
      language to have a conversation— typically by manifesting symbols on the
      palm of your hand— with someone who is within 60 feet and able to see you.
      The shifting patterns can be noticed by other observers within 60 feet; if
      you wish to keep the conversation discrete, you can hide it with a
      Charisma (Deception) check opposed by the observer’s Wisdom (Perception or
      Insight) check. If you fail, it means the observer notices your shifting
      patterns, though they don’t understand the meaning unless they also know
      skin cant.</p>
