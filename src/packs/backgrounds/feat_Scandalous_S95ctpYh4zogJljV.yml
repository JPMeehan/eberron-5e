      <p>Your family name and your alleged failures are known far and wide.
      Nobles and loyal commoners may put up a polite front as propriety demands,
      but they are inclined to think the worst of you. Meanwhile, there are
      plenty who seek to capitalize on your position. You can always seek a

      with a local criminal leader.</p>
