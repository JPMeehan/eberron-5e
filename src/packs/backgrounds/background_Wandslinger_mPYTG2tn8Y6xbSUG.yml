      <p>Bows and blades are tools of the past. Magic is the future, and any
      capable combatant needs to know how to cast a cantrip. You’re quick with a
      wand and a simple spell. Did you serve in the Last War? Were you a
      smuggler, or an enforcer in the criminal underworld? Whatever your past,
      you know that there’s always opportunities for someone with steady hands
      and good aim.</p>
