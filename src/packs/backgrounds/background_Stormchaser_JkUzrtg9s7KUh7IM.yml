      <p>Ever since you were young, you’ve been fascinated by the more...
      dangerous aspects of nature. You’ve had a knack for getting yourself into
      — and out of — trouble faster than most people can blink, and where others
      see a threat to their lives or a terror to be feared, you see your next
      big rush of adrenaline. Perhaps you are planetouched in some way, gifted
      with innate magical talents that keep you safe even in the wildest of wild
      zones, or perhaps you simply enjoy the risk.</p><p>To absolutely nobody’s
      surprise, you signed on with your local branch of the Stormchasers’ Guild,
      a group of adventuring daredevils dedicated to navigating and running
      errands through Syrkarn’s many wild zones. Your partnership with the
      guild, as in most cases, is fairly loose — they will support you in your
      own endeavors, as long as you complete the occasional errand or mission
      for them every so often. While others may look down on you or scorn your
      perceived lack of self-preservation, you realize that someone has to
      undertake these dangerous jobs — and besides, you’ve survived this long,
      haven’t you?</p>
