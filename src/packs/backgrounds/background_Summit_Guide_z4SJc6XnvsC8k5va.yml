    value: >-
      <p>You are one of Adar’s finest, a guide who has been trusted to brave the
      paths in and out of the Land of Refuge. It’s a dangerous life at best, and
      you have risked life and limb time and time again to bring refugees to
      safety. Your mind is hardened, and you know there are worse things than
      death if you are caught. But for every danger the Summit Road brings, it
      is worth it to see another Riedran find a way to freedom.</p>
