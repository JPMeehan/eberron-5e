      <p>Running into Khyber is madness. Regularly running through Khyber is
      your specialty. The dromite city states have long trained runners to go
      through Khyber, delivering messages and packages over long distances. Long
      ago, this was one of many mail-carrying services that Sarlona had access
      to; these days, it is the only way to deliver something from Tashana to
      Adar in a day.</p><p>Your route might not have many destinations; in fact,
      it’s probably safest that you only know of a few routes. Even so, if
      someone needs to get from one end of Sarlona to the other in a day, you
      just might know the way— so long as they don’t mind running very, very
      fast.</p>
