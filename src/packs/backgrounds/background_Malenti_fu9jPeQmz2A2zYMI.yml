    value: >-
      <p>You were born a sahuagin in the Eternal Dominion of the Thunder Sea,
      but ritual magic and the blood of the kar’lassa allowed you to consume and
      replace a surface dweller. You can never regain your original form; for
      all intents and purposes, you are who you appear to be. You’re physically
      indistinguishable from them, and you have enough of their memories to fool
      even their family and friends. But you have the mind of a sahuagin, and
      you’re loyal to the Dominion.</p><p>As a malenti, the first question is
      why the Dominion chose to replace this particular person, and how your
      mission relates to your activities as an adventurer. It’s possible that
      your only mission is to observe the dryskins and occasionally provide
      information to a sahuagin spymaster, or you might have a specific goal
      that drives your actions during your adventures. The Suggested
      Characteristics tables provide information about your
      mission.</p><p>You’re physically identical to the creature you appear to
      be; you are an elf, or a kalashtar, or whatever race you replaced. It is
      up to you and your DM to decide how widespread malenti are in Khorvaire.
      It could be that the Dominion has placed many malenti in the Five Nations,
      or you might be one of the first. If this is the case, you may be the
      first malenti to duplicate a creature of this particular race or species.
      This could be particularly interesting with a kalashtar—you’ve inherited
      the spiritual bond with a quori, but what does that mean for you? Will the
      tie to the alien spirit change you? Similarly, if you possess a
      dragonmark, it seems to function normally, but will there be strange
      consequences in your future?</p><p>It’s possible that your abilities
      reflect additional Dominion magebreeding or skills from your sahuagin
      side. If you’re a barbarian, does your rage reflect the blood frenzy of
      the sahuagin? If you’re a sorcerer, is spellcasting a gift your victim
      already possessed, or is it the result of sahuagin modification? And how
      has the integration of the new personality affected you? Are you still a
      true sahuagin, devoted to the Dominion? Or are the victim’s memories and
      experiences causing you to question your mission?</p><h3>Tour of
      Duty</h3><p>As a malenti, you’ve stolen the identity of a surface dweller.
      But when did this occur? How long have you been playing this role, and how
      comfortable are you with
      it?</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.eberron-5e.tables.RollTable.jRSMqqd4YtTBW7v3
