      <p>You possess a dragonmark, but you weren’t born into one of the houses.
      You may know your family history and why your ancestors left their
      house—or it may have come as a surprise when you manifested your mark.
      Whatever the details, you have no interest in joining some soulless house
      guild. Do you hide your mark, hoping to avoid the attention of the houses?
      Or do you wield its powers proudly, ready to rebuff any house agents that
      come looking for you?</p>
