      <p>You’re an urban nomad, wandering from city to city, a force for
      change—much like the Traveler who bestowed you with your supernatural
      gifts. You spent your childhood traveling with your family, using your
      abilities to evade your enemies and ensure the single-skins give you
      whatever you need. Your family is part of a wider network of changeling
      clans, and you can take advantage of the havens, traditions, and personas
      your people have sowed across the lands. Most travelers are changelings.
      If you’re not a changeling, you were born to a changeling parent and grew
      up around them; you may even use a disguise kit or illusion magic to mimic
      their abilities.</p><p>As a traveler, you’re most comfortable on the move
      and dislike staying in any one place for too long. Your people’s
      traditions predate the laws of Galifar, and you have little attachment to
      any concept of nation or property; your first loyalty is to your family
      and your friends. Some travelers ignore the laws of the Five Nations, or
      even see tricking single-skins as a sport and enjoy defying them. However,
      most respect the people around them; if they acquire an item from a
      single-skin, they’ll compensate with something of equal value. Some sow
      chaos in the name of the Traveler, while others seek to understand people
      and serve as a bridge between cultures. What path do you
      follow?</p><h3>Fledgling Persona</h3><p>Personas are important tools for
      traveler clans. Every clan has a set of shared personas, identities that
      have an established role in a particular region. But these personas need
      to be refreshed over time, and it’s your duty to develop a new persona
      that can be useful to the clan. Over the course of your adventuring
      career, you’re expected to establish useful connections and build a
      positive reputation for this identity. You can select your persona from
      the Personas table or roll randomly, then add details to develop them into
      a unique
      identity.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.eberron-5e.tables.RollTable.o5of924Aj0U5kPJf
