      <p>Your family has risen to the aristocracy very recently. Service to the
      crown, a heroic deed, or an extraordinarily generous donation may have
      contributed to your success. Though older and more entrenched noble
      families meet their obligations toward you, they may still look on you
      with disdain. Meanwhile, there is no shortage of other folks looking to
      ride your coattails to a new and better life.</p>
