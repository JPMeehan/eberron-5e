    value: >-
      <p>At some point in your life, you chose to walk through Ahdryatmin, the
      great Lamannian wild zone at Adar’s heart. Whether a trip made out of
      necessity or religious devotion, you did not come out the same. The
      ancient spirit within the wild zone blessed you, and with it, charged you
      with grand purpose. Your patron is enigmatic, certainly, but with their
      blessing comes wisdom — and perhaps other benefits as well.</p><h3>All
      Walks of Life</h3><p>Ahydratmin is a truly ancient being, one that has
      imparted knowledge of the ages to humanoids, dragons, and immortals alike.
      There is no rhyme nor reason as to who is given an audience with them. Who
      were you before? Are you still that person now? Have you abandoned your
      life for a new purpose, or do you try and balance that with the duties of
      your patron? You can select a Previous Occupation below or roll randomly,
      then add details to determine just the type of person Ahdryatmin chose to
      bless.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.eberron-5e.tables.RollTable.Tue5zK07nP7aPlv2
