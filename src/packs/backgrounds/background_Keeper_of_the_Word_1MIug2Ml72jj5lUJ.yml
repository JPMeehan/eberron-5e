    value: >-
      <p>You belong to the Keepers of the Word, an order of arcanists
      established by exiles from around Sarlona. Your order is dedicated to
      uncovering arcane secrets, and you have vowed to ensure nothing is lost
      again, even if that knowledge is dangerous in the wrong hands. You are a
      researcher, a historian, and a bit nosy; expect other Adarans to consider
      you all three.</p>
