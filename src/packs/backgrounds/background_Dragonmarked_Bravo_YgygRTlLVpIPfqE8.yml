      <p>Your work for your house took advantage of your strength and speed.
      Were you a mercenary fighting in the Last War? A guardian protecting your
      family’s assets and interests? A laborer moving crates in a warehouse?
      You’re a dragonmarked heir and still have good standing with your family,
      but you find the freewheeling life of an adventurer to be more compelling
      than following all the rules and regulations of one of the house
      guilds.</p>
