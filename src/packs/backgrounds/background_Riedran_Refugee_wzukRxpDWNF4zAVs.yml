    value: >-
      <p>You ran away. By some combination of miracle and desperation, you made
      it out of Riedra and into Adar. Your life has not been easy, and in fact
      has gotten harder in many ways. You barely know how to read and write. The
      concept of calendars and days of the week is still foreign. You dream your
      own dreams, and you have to navigate a world where you finally have to
      make your own choices. But for you, this still beats living under Riedraâ€™s
      thumb, because anything would be better than living in the shadow of the
      Unity.</p>
