      <p>Many people still remember the old days. When you arrive in a new
      settlement, talk to your DM about creating an NPC you know from your old
      life. If you make contact, they treat you favorably and offer you food and
      shelter. This NPC might be a member of your household or a commoner who
      used to live under your aegis, or you can roll on the table below to
      choose.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.eberron-5e.tables.RollTable.sNrNOo2r1MwsCWX5
