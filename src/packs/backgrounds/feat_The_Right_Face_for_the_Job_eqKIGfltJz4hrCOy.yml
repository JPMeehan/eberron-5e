  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Traveler clans use well-established personas to secure shelter and
      information wherever they go. This could be a priest who will receive
      sustenance at the local temple, a folk hero who will be sheltered by the
      common people, or a veteran soldier who can always get a bed at the local
      garrison. When you’re approaching a new community, work with the DM to
      determine if there could be a persona with roots in that place; as long as
      you play that role, you can usually obtain modest food and lodging and
      gain access to local gossip. </p><p>In addition, when you encounter other
      members of your clan, you can ask them for help or information, provided
      this doesn’t place them at risk. However, this is a two-way street; if
      another member of your clan approaches you with a reasonable request,
      you’re expected to provide assistance.</p>
