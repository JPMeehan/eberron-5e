    value: >-
      <p>You were born into a Dragonmarked House and trained to use your
      knowledge and wits in the service of your family. You may have worked in
      sales, engaged in research, or even worked as an engineer or an
      administrator. You’re still a dragonmarked heir and you’ll always have a
      place in your house if you choose it, but for now you’d rather seek your
      own fortune and find challenges beyond the walls of your house
      enclave.</p>
