          <p>Bards who follow the College of the Fury know that intense revelry,
          unbound by taboo and pretenses of decency, is among the most powerful
          expressions of the Music of Creation. These bards are overtly
          passionate, sometimes hedonistic, and eager to call others into their
          dance. Harpies of the Cazhaak Creed are the most common practitioners
          of this college, reveling in Szorawai’s name.</p>

          <p>Clerics of the Aspiration domain consider themselves mentors—though
          others are more likely to call them tempters. They offer forbidden
          knowledge and challenge people to live up to their full potential,
          eschewing the confines of what others might consider right, proper, or
          safe. The most common clerics to earn these gifts of the faith are
          followers of the Shadow under the Cazhaak Creed.</p>

          <p>Paladins who are called to follow in the footsteps of a great hero
          take the Oath of Veneration. The Tairnadal are the most common culture
          in Eberron to keep these ideals, taking up arms in hopes of emulating
          the patron ancestor assigned to them by the Keepers of the Past.
          However, this path isn't limited to the elves. A goblinoid warrior
          might choose to emulate ancient Dhakaani heroes, or a human of the
          Five Nations might consider themself the inheritor of Karrn the
          Conqueror’s will.</p><h5>Tenets Of Veneration</h5><p>The tenets of the
          Oath of Veneration challenge a paladin to uphold the legend of a
          treasured ancestor.</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Respect the
          Past.</strong></em> The deeds and legends of our ancient ancestors are
          our greatest treasure.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Emulate Your
          Patron.</strong></em> Keep your patron ancestor’s stories alive by
          reliving their victories.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Fight for Your
          Future.</strong></em> Resist the tyranny your ancestors devoted their
          lives to defeating.</p></li></ul>

          <p>As a rogue, you know that the path to peace and prosperity is
          rarely as virtuous as the Vassals of the Sovereign Host claim. Victory
          must be won by pragmatism, sacrifice, and the blood of those who
          aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty—like you. With these tenets,
          you ask the Dark Six for the gift of their power.</p><p>Though some
          Dark Petitioners worship the Six as great leaders to venerate and
          emulate, many among the Five Nations don’t hold their patrons in such
          high esteem. For these petitioners, their rites and rituals instead
          serve to appease the dark powers, and to turn the Six’s attention to
          their enemies. Do you enjoy the power of Dol Azur’s blessing on a
          poisoned blade? Or do you only hope that your offerings to the Mockery
          will cause your opponent to stumble first?</p>
