          <p>You harness Kythri’s storm of elemental chaos, in an attempt to
          find order among the havoc and bend it to your will. This tradition is
          particularly common among the druids of Maszani, or other settlements
          in proximity to Kythri wild zones, though it also comes naturally to
          Kythri-based planetouched as a whole. Many chaos druids find that
          their appearance changes as their abilities grow stronger: your hair
          and eyes might change color based on which element you’re attuned to,
          or your features might shift constantly, as difficult to pin down as
          the magic you channel.</p>

          <p>The Summit Road isn’t for the faint of heart: its members face
          threats from within as well as without, and as a result, secrecy and
          vigilance are absolute necessities. Many guides receive the training
          typical of the ranger class, but with a focus on stealth and
          protecting their allies. Not every member of the Summit Road has
          levels in this specific subclass — it’s meant to represent what an
          elite scout would mechanically look like</p>

          <p>Many chaotic people feel that freedom is the right of all beings,
          and this is nowhere believed more than in Syrkarn. The Path of
          Reconstruction and the Spirit of Syrkarn give access to this domain,
          but so does the Sundered Heart. Freedom means different things to
          different people, and there are those who feel it should mean the
          freedom to kill and destroy whatever they please. Even the
          good-aligned followers of this domain often clash with their more
          lawful allies.</p><p> On other settings, gods such as Trithereon and
          Aerdrie Faenya offer it</p>

      description:
        value: >-
          <p>The yuan-ti may be the descendants of fallen shulassakar, but this
          doesn’t mean they cannot attempt to rise again. Among these
          communities, a new sorcerous tradition has begun to emerge, consisting
          of yuan-ti who practice magic similar to that of the couatls in an
          attempt at redeeming themselves. This subclass is not race-locked:
          anyone with yuan-ti or shulassakar ancestry, regardless of their
          mechanical race, is capable of learning it.</p>
