          <p>The Hearth domain is not just about safety, security, and the
          gentle glow of a fire when the day is done. It's about finding warmth
          in the love of friends and family, supporting each other through thick
          and thin, and building a community that feels like home.</p><p>Clerics
          to Boldrei of the Sovereign Host often choose this domain, as well as
          devotees of the Path of Light, believing the best way to combat
          darkness is to seek goodness in community. A Cyran seeking a new home
          for their loved ones might gravitate toward such a calling, driven not
          by religion, but their own love for their people. Or a halfling
          bearing the Mark of Hospitality could dedicate themselves to
          furthering their community, drawing on the mark's powers of hearth and
          home. </p>

          <p>Unlike most warlocks, you didn’t make a deal with a powerful
          mysterious patron. Rather, you found an elemental; perhaps it was
          already bound, perhaps you bound it yourself, or perhaps found the
          spark deep within your own spirit. Regardless of your methodology, you
          are the master of this relationship, and you take what you need from
          it without being at its beck and call.</p><p>The Sulatar drow of the
          Xen'drik jungles are true masters of the art of elemental binding,
          able to control bound fire elementals without need for a dragonmark.
          Binding a fire elemental to their soul is merely an extension of that
          ability.</p><p>Gnomes of Zilargo are also known to follow this path as
          a result of their own elemental binding skills, and though they lack
          the same fundamental connection as the Sulatar, they are far more
          varied in their elemental types.</p><p>Far more rarely, planetouched
          folks might have a deep, intrinsic connection to an outer plane that
          exemplifies an elemental as part of their very nature. Such creatures
          as genasi or tieflings of Fernia have a connection to the elements
          that's deeper even than the Sulatar, and their bond can reach depths
          that the drow of Xen'drik can only dream of. </p>

          <p>Weather is a primal source of power, and no weather is more iconic
          than that of the howling winds of a tornado, the thunderous rebuke of
          a thunderstorm, or the torrential rainfall of a hurricane. While some
          sorcerers claim to harness the power of the storm, you know this to be
          a lie. The storm cannot be tamed—it is merely ridden and guided by a
          wise hand. You know the lullabies that can call and soothe the storms,
          and the anthems that summon a mighty tempest to take away the breath
          of those who deny its power.</p><p>Adepts of the Devourer are by far
          the most common practitioners of this circle, especially sahuagin and
          privateers. House Lyrandar's dragonmarked heirs often can manifest
          these powers, as do some humans of the Seren Islands. However, any
          sailor who lives on the seas and has sufficient respect for the Storm
          might learn to channel these abilities.</p><p>Though the nomads of the
          Tashana Tundra have little familiarity with the sea, their unique
          relationship with planar powers means that druids of the Storm are not
          unknown there. </p>

          with curiosity. Warlocks of the Hidden One might be chosen due to
          their important positions, with influence to change nations through
          seemingly insignificant actions. However, the innocuous figure of a
          servant or simple guard is easily ignored, and their ranks might
          include a warlock of the Hidden One, with eyes ever-open. </p>

          <p>A wild animal lies deep within your soul, but long practice and
          meditation allow you to harness its power and control the beast, not
          the other way around. This path is most commonly followed by shifters
          honing their natural abilities, but its adherents are also found among
          the tribes of the Demon Wastes and among lycanthropes, their bodies
          twisted by unnatural powers. Rarely, one born in a Lamannian manifest
          zone might find this path, and rumor tells of a rare breed of symbiont
          in the dwarven Realm Below that can transform its host, granting
          increased power in exchange for a terrifying appearance. Rarest of all
          are the kalashtar and Inspired who take up this path; projecting an
          image of their tsoreva spirit, the damage their mindblades deal is
          very real.</p>

          that ended four ages of the world. This rare power might blossom

          history or a descendant of those affected by the great cataclysms of
          the past, a Cataclysm Mage can spring from anywhere, a sign of the
          Prophecy unfolding. </p>

          provided tactical expertise and controlled the legions of undead that
          the Blood of Vol priesthood raised to defend the Karrnathi
          people.</p><p>Although the founders of the order of Bone Knights were
          powerful members of the Emerald Claw, they recruited freely from
          amongst the populace, seeking those with the ability and willpower to
          control the dead, rather than prioritizing matters of faith. In
          post-war Karrnath, the surviving Bone Knights are elite emissaries who
          travel abroad to complete missions that serve the greater glory of
          Karrnath and King Kaius III. The only recognized Bone Knight training
          facilities are located in Karrnath, and most come from that grim land.
          However, the Order of the Emerald Claw pioneered the order, so a new
          trainee could crop up anywhere their reach extends.</p><p>Though

          <p>Some barbarians are overcome by a fury powered not entirely by
          their own will, crackling with arcane power. Known as Rage Mages,
          these barbarians can cast a limited number of spells even while
          raging, and slowly develop the ability to have magic bleeding out of
          them into their melee attacks. </p><p>In Khorvaire, Rage Mages are
          most often found among Mournborn warped by the Day of Mourning,
          creatures touched by Kythri, and bearers of aberrant dragonmarks. The
          reality storms that wrack Sarlona might also produce Rage Mages, and
          sailors of the Thunder Sea claim they've seen sahuagin who've
          demonstrated similar abilities. Few others have the necessary
          connection to the raw eldritch power needed to follow this path</p>

          assassin guilds also train their members in these arts, finding their
          tactics are just as effective on the city streets as beneath the cover

          due to the persecution that they face in Riedra and the elves'
          affinity for necromancy.</p><p>The only continent that they do not

          native of that continent has ever been recorded as hearing this
          calling. </p>

          of the Droaamish warlords, more often than not, the Knights of Kell
          are bound only to the service of these enigmatic hag queens. Natives
          of Droaam recognize the brand of a Kell Knight, but elsewhere in the
          world, the Mark of Kell draws indifference or passing curiosity. As
          knights continue in service, the rewards gifted by their patrons
          increase exponentially, but few survive long enough to see the
          pinnacle of their knighthood due to their bizarre and dangerous
          missions.</p><p>Although most Kell Knights are in Droaam, they can be
          found across the Five Nations, serving the interests of the Daughters.
          Sora Teraza has been known to recruit servitors via their dreams, and

          Night Mother herself.</p><p><em><strong>By Hook.</strong></em> Your
          actions should import your mission’s weight. Callous cruelty is
          unnecessary, but everyone must know their place. Respect the chain of
          command and assert your authority.</p><p><em><strong>By
          Crook.</strong></em> A fool is friend to many, but used by all. Guile
          and deception are at your disposal to complete your objectives. A
          competent knight always has a plan.</p><p><em><strong>By
          Book.</strong></em> Knowledge is a universal commodity. Whether it be
          advantage over your foes or long-kept secrets, you always strive to
          learn and to share that information—for a price. <br /></p>

          only to trusted Chosen artisans, the kalashtar of Adar developed
          similar practices with a healthier respect for the artificerâ€™s own
          mind. Adaran refugees eventually introduced the practice to Khorvaire,
          though it remains little more than an academic curiosity outside

          awry in the Mournland. These wizards' expertise is on how the Day of
          Mourning affected magic cast on that day, turning spells into
          constructs of trapped magical energy. These wizards have discovered
          how to create a living spell of their own, small enough to tame, yet
          holding enormous potential within.</p><p>Lucia ir'Brenith, a Cyran
          refugee living in New Cyre, is the mother of this movement, and her
          lab has become a haven for anyone wishing to study the Mournland and
          living spells in particular. Her research stays well-financed by
          Prince Oargev, who holds out hope that her work can lead to something
          that would explain the Mourning. </p>

          <p>Druids of the Circle of Eberron communicate with the progenitor
          Eberron herself. They can hear her words in the passage of the winds,
          and read her messages in leaves of the forest and shifting sands of
          the desert. These druids believe in the sacredness of all life, and
          can entreat the world to provide them with an ally formed out of
          Eberron's body in times of need. They are staunch opponents of
          extraplanar creatures that seek to impose their will on their world,
          such as creatures from Khyber and Xoriat.</p><p>Many Gatekeepers find
          themselves drawn to this circle, as well as hermits who spend decades
          listening to the heartbeat of the Dragon Between. Adepts of this
          tradition can also be found among iredar kobolds and Talentan mask
          weavers. And to the surprise of many, warforged that seek deep
          connections to the earth might follow this circle, including the
          warforged Followers of the Broken Path and the Landforged Walkers.

          been at birth, and no one bothered to tell you. Or perhaps you died
          later in life, then were subsequently called back from the misty
          embrace of Dolurrh. Whatever the cause, you were dead, briefly—and it
          will not happen again. You seek to first master the power of your own
          blood so you will never be defenseless, then as you increase in power,
          you hear the siren call of the blood of others.</p><p>Due to the cost
          of this power, it's rare to encounter another Blood Magus in the
          world, as most practitioners of this art are scattered. The most
          common place to find a Blood Magus is in Karrnath and anywhere the
          Blood of Vol faith is strong, as adherents of this faith understand
          the intricate link of blood and power. The Bloodsail Principality in
          Lhazaar holds Blood Magi both living and undead; as vampires possess
          the most neceesary of components—blood—they too can learn this art.
          Rumors also tell of Blood Magi hiding deep in the Shadow Marches and
          the Demon Wastes. </p>

          finds its recent origins in Aundairian spellcraft before the Last War.
          It was incorporated into Cyre's elite legions and Breland's Dark

          began. Cyran and Aundairian artificers have the greatest natural
          inclination for the craft.</p><p>Though Aundair proudly claims the War
          Weaver tradition as their own creation, it predates even the arrival
          of humanity on the shores of Khorvaire. The oral traditions of Talenta
          halflings recount rare and powerful War Weavers through the ages,
          though their druidic traditions are far stronger. And earlier still,
          tens of thousands of years ago, elven War Weavers perfected the art
          during their exodus from Xen'drik.</p>

        value: >-
          <p>Monks of the Way of the Conduit learn to listen to spirits and
          ghosts in the world around them, giving each a voice in exchange for
          augmenting the monk's own abilities. Followers of this path teach that
          true enlightenment cannot be found by one's self, but rather, wisdom
          must come from the spirits of those around you. After all, those who
          fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</p><p>The most
          common practitioners of this Way are kalashtar mystics channeling the
          former hosts of their line, as well as Karrnathi monks who bind heroic
          spirits to help them in battle. A more unusual tradition exists among
          the orcs and shifters of the Eldeen Reaches and Shadow Marches, who
          communicate with spirits of nature and bargain with them for aid.
          Certain halfling adepts of the Talenta Plains also communicate with
          nature spirits as well. </p>
