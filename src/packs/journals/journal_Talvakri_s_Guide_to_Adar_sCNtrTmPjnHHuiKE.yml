          <p>Though the Inspired are capable of devastating psionic power in
          Riedra, the quori are limited in number, and they can only possess one
          empty vessel at a time. When skirmishes happen and combat must be had,
          Riedra instead turns to Chosen unarmed fighters wielding the powers of
          Dal Quor. In response, the kalashtar developed similar techniques
          drawing upon their quori, dubbing their warriors the ‘fists of Dal
          Quor’.</p>

          <p>Those who learn the truth of the Dreaming Dark are often terrified
          by its implications for Eberron and the world. A small number of those
          choose to strike back against the quori. An even smaller number choose
          to fight the quori with their own. The quori mindhunters have found
          ways to trap quori within their minds, drawing upon the nightmare
          spirit and its power while keeping it bound. It is one of the most
          dangerous ways to fight the Dreaming Dark, as the bound quori is
          constantly struggling against its bonds, but the powers it can bring
          against the Inspired are devastating.</p>

          <p>While Hazgaal is best known for his acceptance of the rebel quori
          to Adar, before he became Haztaratai, he developed a form of martial
          arts that merged Adar’s sturdy mountains with the crackling lightning
          of its storms. The Haztaratain order is its official name, but it is
          better known colloquially as the Way of the Summit Sentinel (or
          parahdi in Adaran).</p>

          <p>Your patron is one you have never met, though you see them
          regularly. They come to you in your dreams, and whisper of your
          potential, revealing to you pathways to power. Though you can only
          vaguely recall these encounters, the powers they grant you are real.
          But does that necessarily mean your patron is real as well? Is the
          visage in your dreams an entity foreign to your mind, come to visit
          you in the night and entreat with or tempt you? Or is the visage your
          own, a glimpse into your future, one where you wield the power of
          dreams?</p>

          <p>Whether you were descended from an otherworldly bloodline, born in
          a wild zone, or encountered a reality storm later in life, the spark
          of your sorcerous talents was ignited by planar energy. However, just
          as the Material Plane itself feels the influence of all planes, your
          power is not tied to a single extraplanar realm. Instead, your magic
          is drawn from all planes, granting you the power to reach across the
          barriers that separate them.</p>

          <p>Ghoza Monastery was built within a great Kythri manifest zone.
          Within the shifting elemental halls, its martial artists have
          developed a fighting style that draws upon the Churning Chaos,
          blending them together in a seamless display of elemental power.
          Practitioners can summon jets of flame, bend water to their will, and
          at their pinnacle, even control the weather.</p>

          <p>For most sorcerers, their innate magical talent is akin to that of
          a sculptor. The sculptor is not the stone, clay, or wood they sculpt.
          They are but the talent, the will, that shapes the medium of their
          art. For you, however, your talent is your medium. Your magic is not
          an external force, channeled through you to be shaped by arcane
          gestures or words. Your magic is your will itself, manifesting upon
          reality.</p>
