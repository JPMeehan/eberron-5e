          <p>The ancient giants channeled the power of the planes to become
          sorcerers, growing in size in proportion to their arcane power. You
          have inherited this overflowing power, or bound it within you using
          ancient Xen’drik arcana. Unleashed, you can grow into a true titan,
          hurling the destructive power of the elements at your foes - but such
          power comes with a price.</p><p> As a Giant Soul sorcerer, you decide
          how you have inherited your powers, and how it manifests upon you. You
          must also decide how to wield it - as a whirlwind of barely-contained
          power, or as a towering herald of order. The giants of the Battalion
          of Basalt Towers seek to wield their primordial fire to conquer and
          destroy, while the Zephyr Guard of Kul Lerek harness the winds in
          defense of their home.</p>

          <p>Since the dawn of time, the whistling wind, rushing rivers and
          calls of birds have inspired countless works of art. Some bards see
          beauty in the world around us, acting as emissaries to the powers of
          nature, and working with the land as their canvas. The College of
          Nature is less an organization than an ideal - to protect the wonder
          of the wild, and find joy in its splendor. Their commitment to harmony
          allows them to speak to animals, plants, and even elementals. When
          nature comes under attack, they call on those powers to protect it -
          and can unleash devastating natural disasters in defense.</p><p> Bards
          of the College of Nature might use any instrument, from paints, to
          flutes, to dance - anything that allows them to attune to the rhythms
          of the world. In Xen’drik, the Vulkoor, Qaltiar, and Na’qalla drow
          venerate and call upon the spirits of nature, while the Rimewalker
          druids of the Iceflow often speak with the giant animals of their
          home. In Khorvaire, the Greensingers of the Reaches combine druidic
          and bardic traditions to treat with the fey, while the gnomes of
          Lorghalan survive through their close friendship with elementals</p>

          <p>Divine Crucibles are the smiths of the gods, forging relics in
          radiant flame. Their craftwork is belief, and their belief lies in the
          glory of their craft. When heroes seek out blessed weapons to smite
          evil, it’s Crucibles who provide. It is said that each one places a
          divine spark in their masterpieces; in battle, they can ignite these
          sparks, causing the relics to flare with holy fire, and bolster their
          wielders.</p><p> Crucibles can be found across Eberron, serving the
          Silver Flame, or gods of the forge such as Onatar. The Ghaash’kala and
          Shulassakar both rely on skilled Crucibles to forge and shape
          songsilver - the unbreakable essence of the couatl. In Xen’drik, the
          fire giants of the Torch of Progress see the silver flame as a force
          for peace and enlightenment, and create items to support the people.
          Their kin within the hidden city of Daomon once powered their forges
          with the Fernian fires of Onatar, creating sacred relics of the
          Sovereigns - though the Shattering has scattered their works to the
          ashes of time</p>

          <p>Some rangers bear a connection to the primal spirits of the wind,
          using their gifts to soar through the air and strike with zephyr
          speed. Their grace is breathtaking, but a Wind Runner is as elusive as
          they are dangerous. Many are carefree spirits who see beauty in
          freedom; others serve as natural protectors of aeries and high peaks,
          communing with the flying beasts that they see as kin.</p><p> In
          Eberron, Wind Runners are often found in the Zephyr Guard of the
          flying city of Kul Lerek, and among the halfelves of the Mark of
          Storm. Both House Lyrandar and the piratical Wind Whisperers train the
          dragonmarked to harness such skills, especially those who aspire to
          fly an airship. During the Last War, several nations also fielded
          aerial infantry as part of their forces, including the flying Angels
          of Thrane. A Wind Runner might also be touched by the planes of
          Syrania or Lamannia, or be descended from the cloud giants of
          Xen’drik. In Sarlona, Wind Runners can be found in the high mountains
          of Adar, and often form bonds with the nation’s flying asperi
          steeds.</p>

          <p>The many paths of the Draconic Prophecy plot out the course of
          future events. All manner of powerful creatures from the dragons of
          Argonnessen to the fiendish Overlords seek to influence its path,
          often using mortal pawns such as you. You’ve made a pact with a being
          with insights into the future, granting you dark luck and the destiny
          to succeed. As a fateweaver, your powers guide you down a certain
          path, ensuring your success - but don’t push your luck, or you may
          find yourself cutting the strings of your own destiny.</p><p> Examples
          of beings with the power of a Fateweaver include Sphinxes such as
          Flamewind with their mastery of time, the Overlord known as the
          Spinner of Shadows, and the ancient giants of Crux, who may wish to
          restore their planar citystate to its former glory.</p>

          <p>‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’ is normally a joke for
          adventurers. Patchwork Blades are those who take it to the extreme.
          These bestial warriors take on the strength of the creatures they
          hunt, growing in monstrous power with every victory. As consummate
          hunters, Patchwork Blades study their prey, making use of their
          weaknesses. When you fight the ultimate hunters, it takes one to know
          one. Some Blades believe that they receive strength from the gods with
          every kill. Others take a more direct route, and physically alter
          their own forms using the magical blood or remnants of their prey.
          Regardless, all are a fearsome sight, and stray further and further
          from mortality with each notch in the axe.</p><p>Patchwork Blades can
          be flavored in different ways, and can be found in a variety of places
          within Eberron as a result. The greatest number form part of the Wyrd
          Vigil of Vralkast, taking on the horrors of Khyber and warping
          themselves to defend their city. The disciples of the daelkyr Dyrrn
          the Corruptor might also travel such a path, taking the body parts of
          their prey to further their own evolution. Some changelings,
          especially the doppelgangers of Lost, take the opposite approach -
          they study and mimic the forms of others to master their shapechanging
          techniques. Those Patchwork Blades who take on the spiritual strength
          of their prey tend to belong to druidic communities, as well as
          Stormreach’s Lords of the Hunt. The goliaths of the Blood of Kanda see
          The Hunt to be a religious ritual, and take on the aspects of the
          dragons and leviathans of the Dark Sea that they slay in their
          duties.</p>

          <p>The course of your life was forever thrown off-kilter by the
          schemes of those plotting your downfall; now, your heart burns with
          the goal of hunting those who wronged you, empowered by your zeal and
          desire for vengeance. Perhaps you made a deal with a powerful entity
          to give you the tools for murder, or made a binding oath to right the
          wrongs of the past; regardless, you are now an arrow loosed on a
          single path, and none can run from the bite of your steel. Revenger
          rogues are experts at social manipulation, gathering information on
          their foes by reading people’s dark desires - all to bring low the
          targets of their vendettas.</p><p> In Eberron, Revengers might arise
          from any number of situations. In Xen’drik, the overlord known as the
          Scar that Abides is an incarnation of cold rage, and empowers his
          servants to violently deal with perceived slights against him. The
          Spinner of Shadows also gives dark pacts to those seeking revenge,
          changing their destinies to spread pain and suffering through the
          land. Revengers can also arise through sincere personal oaths. Those
          who lost everything in the Last War, Cyran avengers, and followers of
          the Fury might all walk down this dark path.</p>

          <p>Delving into ruins and dungeons lost to time is a common pastime
          for many would-be adventurers. Typically, this is a gamble on one’s
          life. Explorers don’t just gamble on their lives - they go all in,
          every time. Whether through skill, gumption, or divinely-blessed luck,
          these heroes of tavern tales are famed for their derring-do. It’s not
          just about finding treasure; it’s about the thrill and adventure to an
          almost obsessive degree.</p><p> A true Explorer is marked by their
          luck, their keen sense for traps and survival, and their faith in
          throwing hands at any problem that comes their way. In Xen’drik, such
          individuals share drinks together in the taverns of Stormreach, the
          merchant guilds of Kul Lerek, and the halls of Blackgrove Refuge.
          Professional explorers can also be found in the adventuring guilds of
          Khorvaire, including the Wayfinder Foundation, and Clifftop Guild.</p>

          <p>The school of Oneiromancy was born in the nascent Cul’sir Empire,
          and led to its dominion over the surrounding lands. The giants shaped
          dreams to sustain their kingdom, weaving them into its very
          foundations. Now, the link to the Sea of Dreams is severed, but those
          who pursue its study can still walk the same path. Oneiromancers
          believe that dreams are inspirational and prophetic; their magic
          removes the barrier between dream and consciousness, allowing them to
          live within surreal worlds of their own. The primary mission of many
          such wizards is to restore their school to glory - by repairing the
          damaged planar link to the wonder found behind closed eyes.</p><p> As
          an Oneiromancy Wizard, you may have stumbled upon ancient giant texts,
          or relics of the Quori, that kickstarted your path into lost and
          ancient magic. Perhaps you see your own dreams as inspirational and
          prophetic, or use them to communicate with the Quori of your kalashtar
          lineage. Or, stranger still, you were a mind long trapped in Dal Quor,
          and found your way out in a fitting mortal host. Either way, the
          dream-scarred lands of Xen’drik are sure to hold the secrets you
          seek…</p>

          <p>The Oath of Freedom is a vow to fight back against the tyrants,
          conquerors, and slavers who would use their power to oppress others.
          Paladins who swear this oath believe that all have the right to
          dictate their own path, and often act as noble revolutionaries and
          freedom fighters. When an invading army oppresses a nation, when a
          tyrant king imprisons his people, or a criminal group begins dealing
          in lives, that is when the Oath of Freedom rises.</p><p>In Xen’drik,
          both the Unbound Brigade and the Silaes Tairn often embody the Oath,
          fighting against the giants who once enslaved them and their kin.
          Their sworn enemies are those such as the Battalion of Basalt Towers,
          who would use ancient magic to rule over the continent once more. In
          Khorvaire, Oath of Freedom paladins arose during the Last War,
          especially in conquered cities such as Thaliost, or rebelling nations

          <p>Druids of the Verdant Circle are floral guardians of plant life,
          finding purpose in the beauty of vegetation. They see purity and
          wonder in primal forest, and strength in the ancient trees of the
          wilds. A verdant druid might go for months in the deep jungles without
          seeing another soul, pursuing their goal of protecting nature from the
          ravages of unnatural threats. Druids of this circle often find the
          line blurred between plants and animals, and take on aspects of the
          flora they protect when defending their ‘friends’. Fighting such a
          warrior in the wilds is to have the very land turn against you, as
          plants rise up to support them in a wave of branches and tangled
          briars.</p><p> In Eberron, the largest group of such druids are the
          Verdant Path in Xen’drik, who learn from and protect the land spirit
          Kwinharin. Their home in the Rainwoods is draped with ancient moss and
          vines that hang between gargantuan trees. Others can be found in the
          Na’qalla drow, and the Rushemé druids. In Khorvaire, Verdant druids
          can be found in the Eldeen reaches, especially among the devout
          followers of the Greatpine Oalian. The strangest are those who deal
          with aberrant and planar flora - the cultists of the daelkyr Avassh,
          and the bizarre gardeners of the Grim Lord Varonaen on the umbral
          island of Farlnen</p>

          <p>Since the dawn of time, mortals have gazed with wonder and fear
          upon the titans of the natural world. Behemoth druids are those who
          find strength in the existence of such giants, for what greater sign
          can there be of the power of nature? Many find purpose in living
          alongside whales, dinosaurs, and other immense beasts, protecting them
          from harmful poaching and unnatural threats. In doing so, they gain
          insights into their roles in nature - and learn to take on their forms
          to terrifying effect.</p><p> Behemoth druids can be found wherever
          such creatures congregate, from the mountain aeries of giant eagles,
          to the vast plains on which sauropods roam. Some are more than happy
          to welcome visitors, as long as they agree not to disturb the titans
          before them. Others are brutal and wild, tracking prey alongside
          powerful dinosaurs and predatory beasts. Perhaps the strangest are
          those who live in the Astral Plane, and ride beneath the stars with
          celestial kindori whales.</p>

          <p>Since the dawn of history, mortalkind has prayed to the gods for
          bountiful hunts. Taking down prey means survival; failure means
          becoming prey in turn. Clerics of the Hunt domain take up this ancient
          duty, ensuring that luck is on their allies' side, while joining the
          battle with bow and spear. To them, their prey are part of the cycle
          of life, and sent as divine gifts that should never be
          squandered.</p><p> Hunt domain clerics seek to protect the course of
          nature, often by hunting monsters that would threaten communities or
          upset the local balance. Many fiercely oppose poachers. The concept of
          hunting creatures for sport without making use of their sacrifice, or
          respecting their strength, is anathema to their beliefs. In Eberron,
          Hunt doman clerics can be found worshiping the god Balinor in
          Khorvaire, especially in the Eldeen Reaches and Lhazaar
          Principalities. In Xen’drik, the Vulkoori and Qaltiar drow worship the
          aspect of Vulkoor known as the Hunter, while goliaths descended from
          the Esht Primacy often venerate Banor the Bloody Spear.</p>

          <p>Whether through the ancestry of an efreet, a deal with a demon, or
          an elemental influence, those on the Path of the Pyreheart draw from a
          very real inner fire. These barbarians summon flames that sear their
          enemies and smolder within superheated veins.</p><p> Pyrehearts can
          draw from a number of different sources ranging from the demonic to
          the artificial. A Warforged might possess an inner furnace or be
          imbued with a bound elemental, casting forth flames like the famous
          Lord of Blades. The chieftain of a Carrion Tribe might hurl demonic
          flames at her foes, born from the influence of the Demon Wastes, or a
          pact with the Overlord Kharna Rayva. A Tiefling touched by Fernia or
          Lamannia might find their anger manifesting as elemental fire - a
          dangerous ability for those unaware of their birthright. A Pyreheart
          is often physically marked by their inner flame, which you can
          determine by rolling on the table below:</p>
