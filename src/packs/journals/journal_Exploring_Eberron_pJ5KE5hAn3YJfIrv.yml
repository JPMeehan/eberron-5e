          <p>The daashor artificers of the Dhakaani Empire were the finest
          weaponsmiths in Khorvaire’s history, as discussed in chapter 4 of this
          book. As a Forge Adept, you carry on these ancient traditions,
          creating mystical weapons and armor, strengthening allies on the
          battlefield, and bringing down enemies with weapons imbued with your
          own soul energy. If you’re dar, you learned these techniques from the
          masters of your clan. Are you content to follow ancient traditions, or
          do you want to add your own innovations? If you’re not Dhakaani, did
          you learn these techniques from a daashor mentor? Did you steal this
          knowledge? Or are you replicating these traditions on your own?</p>

          <p>In the world of artifice, the Maverick is a jack of all trades and
          master of none. A Maverick is always experimenting with new designs,
          forever abandoning yesterday’s work in pursuit of a new obsession.
          While often dismissed by other artificers as eccentric amateurs, in
          their refusal to follow established tradition, a Maverick may stumble
          on remarkable breakthroughs—though their idiosyncratic techniques can
          rarely be replicated by others.</p>

          <p>Bards of the College of the Dirge Singer are trained to inspire
          their people and direct soldiers on the battlefield. Students of both
          history and war, dirge singers use tales of past glory and their
          knowledge of great victories to inspire their allies and provide keen
          strategic insight, directing allies to strike when enemies are
          weak.</p><p>This ancient tradition was developed in the Empire of
          Dhakaan, and is largely unknown beyond the goblinoids of the Kech
          Dhakaan. The duur’kala—Goblin for dirge singer— are the historians,
          diplomats, and spiritual leaders of the empire. Duur’kala are
          discussed in more detail in chapter 4 of this book. If you’re not one
          of the dar, consider how you came to learn this tradition. Did you
          train with a ghaal’dar mentor? Or did you find your own path to these
          techniques?</p>

          <p>This path blends divine devotion and psychic power. The forces tied
          to the Mind domain teach followers that the mind is the greatest tool
          and the mightiest weapon in creation. A cleric of the Mind domain
          learns to harness their own mental power, then uses this gift to
          protect the faithful and smite enemies.</p><p>In Eberron, the Mind
          domain is most associated with the kalashtar Path of Light and the
          Riedran Path of Inspiration. However, followers of the cults of the
          Dragon Below might also follow this path. While visions of Xoriat can
          certainly drive a priest into madness, they might also reveal deeper
          secrets and mental powers.</p>

          <p>What is truly natural? The warforged are living creatures, despite
          being constructed from wood and steel. Druids who embrace the Circle
          of the Forged explore the potential of the warforged form, blending
          animal shapes with warforged durability. This is a young path,
          pioneered by a handful of warforged who sought a greater understanding
          of their role in the world. Over the last few decades, a number of
          warforged have embraced the Circle of the Forged; however, it isn’t
          limited to warforged; a Cannith heir or an aspiring artificer might
          pursue primal power as a way to transcend the limited flesh they were
          born with.</p><p>Only a handful of druids follow this Circle. Did you
          learn these techniques from a mentor? Are you driven by instinct,
          still learning what you’re capable of? Or, if you’re a warforged, were
          you designed with the potential to assume multiple forms . . . and if
          so, who created you, and why?</p>

          <p>A monk following the Way of the Living Weapon pursues physical
          perfection, honing their body as a smith sharpens a sword. Its
          traditions are drawn from cultures of shapeshifters and creatures who
          fight with tooth and claw. These are a few of the martial techniques
          that have evolved into the Way of the Living Weapon.</p><ul><li><p>The
          Forged Heart is a recent path, developed by warforged exploring the
          potential of their constructed frames. This involves both the physical
          evolution of the body and harnessing the strength of steel and
          stone.</p></li><li><p>The Nightmare Shroud is a kalashtar tradition.
          Rather than physically transforming, nightmare monks generate
          ectoplasmic projections, manifesting claws of shadow. Blending
          physical blows with psychic attacks, they strike fear into the mind of
          their enemies. A kalashtar typically surrounds themselves with the
          image of their quori spirit, but the shroud can take any
          shape.</p></li><li><p>The Traveler’s Blade was developed by tribal
          changelings, providing the practitioner with versatile weapons that
          can’t be taken away. A practitioner can grow bone blades or knuckle
          ridges, or stretch their limbs to strike a distant
          foe.</p></li><li><p>The Weretouched techniques were developed by
          shifter champions of Olarune, honing the natural weapons and strengths
          of the shifter</p></li></ul>
