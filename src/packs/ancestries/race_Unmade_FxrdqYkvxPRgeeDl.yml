    value: >-
      <p>You do not have the luxury of forgetting that the Unmaker rages beneath
      the weight of Korrandar. You are a sakah, a tiefling who has gained their
      fiendish influence from an Overlord, and the influence of Ran Iishiv is
      written on your disintegrating horns and shattered ceramic skin. Though
      mortal and capable of choosing your own destiny, many consider you a sign
      of ill omen at best.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. You are Medium or Small. You choose
      the size when you select this species.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your
      walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see
      in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in
      darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only
      as shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Oblivion Resistance</strong>. You have
      resistance to force and necrotic damage.</p><p>Omen of the End. Other
      creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on death saving throws.
      While you are conscious, creatures of your choice you can see are immune
      to this trait.</p><p>Aura of Unmaking. Starting at 3rd level, as a bonus
      action you can activate your aura, an emanation of annihilation and
      existential dread, that lasts for 1 minute or until you end it with
      another bonus action. While your aura is active, at the end of each of
      your turns, each creature within 10 feet of you takes force damage equal
      to your proficiency bonus and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8
      + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of
      you until the end of your next turn.</p><p>Once you activate your aura,
      you canâ€™t activate it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
