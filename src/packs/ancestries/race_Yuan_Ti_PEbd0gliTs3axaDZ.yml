      <p>Not every shulassakar wishes to follow the path set out to them by the
      couatl. You have lost your feathers, replacing them with scales, either
      because you committed a grave crime, you chose to leave on your own, or
      because one of your ancestors did one of the above. Your kind are even
      rarer in Adar, and few will understand what your serpentine features
      mean.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. You are Medium or Small. You choose
      the size when you select this species.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your
      walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>. You
      have advantage on saving throws against spells.</p><p><strong>Poison
      Resilience</strong>. You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid
      or end the poisoned condition on yourself. You also have resistance to
      poison damage. </p><p><strong>Serpentine Spellcasting.</strong> You know
