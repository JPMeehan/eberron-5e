    value: >-
      <p>Like your gith brethren, your ancestry comes from another version of
      Eberron. Draconic magic flows through you, a gift from one of the
      surviving gem dragons of Sardior. Unlike your Eberronian counterparts,
      itâ€™s much more likely that you were intentionally created. Whether a gem
      dragon wished for a child or a soldier, you were imbued with purpose and
      drive.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Gem Ancestry</strong>. You have a gem dragon ancestor,
      granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one kind of dragon from
      the Gem Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other
      traits, as shown in the
      table.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Dragon</th><th>Damage
      Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Amethyst</td><td>Force</td></tr><tr><td>Crystal</td><td>Radiant</td></tr><tr><td>Emerald</td><td>Psychic</td></tr><tr><td>Sapphire</td><td>Thunder</td></tr><tr><td>Topaz</td><td>Necrotic</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Breath
      Weapon</strong>. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can
      replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a
      15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving
      throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a
      failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with
      your Gem Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
      This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level
      (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p><p>You can use your Breath Weapon a
      number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all
      expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>Draconic
      Resistance</strong>. You have resistance to the damage type associated
      with your Gem Ancestry.</p><p><strong>Psionic Mind</strong>. You can send
      telepathic messages to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You
      don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand
      these messages, but it must be able to understand at least one language to
      comprehend them.</p><p><strong>Gem Flight</strong>. Starting at 5th level,
      you can use a bonus action to manifest spectral wings on your body. These
      wings last for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal
      to your walking speed and can hover. Once you use this trait, you can't do
      so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
