    value: >-
      <p>Chaos runs through your veins, quite literally. The Churning Chaos has
      imbued you with elemental power, shifting and ever-changing. If you are an
      aasimar, sporting a celestial connection to the Churning Chaos, you may
      have a glowing elemental halo and technicolor wings. If you are a genasi,
      your elemental connection shows in lava cracking your skin and hair always
      blowing in the wind. If you are a tiefling with a spark of chaotic
      fiendish power, you may sport branching horns, cloven feet, and a wide
      array of scales and spines and sulfuric breaths.</p><p><strong>Creature
      Type</strong>. You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. If you
      replace a species with this lineage, use your species to determine your
      size. If you choose this lineage at character creation, you are Medium or
      Small. You choose the size when you select this
      lineage.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ancestral Legacy</strong>. If you replace a species
      with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any
      skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or
      swimming speed you gained from it. If you don't keep any of those elements
      or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in
      two skills of your choice.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see
      in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
      darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness,
      only shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Chaotic Resistance</strong>. You have a
      changing resistance to damage. When you finish a long rest, roll a d6 and
      consult the Chaotic Resistance table below for the damage
      type:</p><p><strong>Planetouched Nature</strong>. When you choose this
      lineage, choose the nature of your planar tie to Kythri: Celestial,
      Elemental, or Fiendish. Your choice grants you one of the traits
      below:</p><p><em><strong>Celestial</strong></em>. When you reach 3rd
      level, you can unleash the celestial energy within yourself as a bonus
      action, transforming yourself for 1 minute or until you end the
      transformation with another bonus action. When you transform, two
      luminous, spectral wings of chaotic energy sprout from your back. Until
      your transformation ends, you have a flying speed equal to your walking
      speed, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra damage to one
      target when you deal damage to it with an attack or spell. The type of
      damage is the same as your current resistance granted by your Chaotic
      Resistance trait, and the amount of extra damage equals your proficiency
      bonus. Once you transform this way, you can’t do so again until you finish
      a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Elemental</strong></em>. When you choose
      this lineage, choose one of the elements on the Chaotic Resistance table.
      You always have resistance to this type of damage, and this resistance is
      separate and in addition to the one granted by your Chaotic Resistance
      trait. If you roll this resistance on the table when you finish a long
      rest, reroll on the table until you gain a different resistance for your
      Chaotic Resistance trait.</p><p><em><strong>Fiendish</strong></em>. You
      know the prestidigitation cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the
      chaos bolt spell with this trait, without requiring a material component.
      Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the blink spell with this trait.
      Once you cast chaos bolt or blink with this trait, you can’t cast that
      spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either
      of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate
      level.</p><p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting
      ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when
      you select this lineage).</p>
