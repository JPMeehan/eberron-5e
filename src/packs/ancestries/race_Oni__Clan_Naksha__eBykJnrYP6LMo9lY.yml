    value: >-
      <p>The ogres of Boranun once bound many types of fiends to their
      bloodlines, creating the first oni. Once upon a time, these oni lines were
      once formed into great clans, and you carry a spark of that ancient
      legacy. Borunan oni stand between 6-8 feet tall depending on their
      fiendish origin and weigh between 200-400 pounds. Oni reach adulthood at
      20 and live up to 150 years</p><p>A cunning winged fiend, such as a horned
      devil or erinyes, is held by the oni of your bloodline. Lies and deceit
      come to you as easily as you breathe, and you can manifest fiendish wings
      to soar through the air - but only for short periods, lest you draw too
      hard on the evil held in your soul. Oni from Clan Naksha are lean,
      confident, and often smaller than their kin from other
      bloodlines.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>: Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Fiendish Wings</strong>. You have vestigial wings. As
      a result, when you fall at least 10 feet, you can use your Reaction to
      safely glide downward, taking no damage from the fall. Additionally, when
      you make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump, you can use your reaction
      to flap your wings and gain advantage on the ability check.</p><p>When you
      reach 5th level, you can channel your inner fiend to strengthen your
      wings, but must limit your reliance on them to avoid corruption. As a
      bonus action, your vestigial wings grow significantly in size for 10
      minutes, until you are incapacitated or you allow your wings to return to
      their natural vestigial state as a bonus action. While your wings are
      grown, you have a fly speed equal to your speed. Once you use this trait
      to grow your vestigial wings, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p><p><strong>Forked Tongue</strong>. You gain proficiency in
      the Deception skill.</p><p><strong>Powerful Build</strong>. You count as
      one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you
      can push, drag, or lift</p>
