      <p>Gargoyles are indistinguishable from stone statues… until they move. In
      Eberron, the first gargoyles were carved by Dhakaani goblins, but it was
      the daelkyr Orlassk who brought them to life. The oldest gargoyles have
      been in a state of torpor for thousands of years. Now they have risen to
      carve out a place of their own in the new nation of
      Droaam.</p><p>Gargoyles are humanoids carved from stone. The horned,
      winged form often associated with the gargoyle is a common design; in
      Eberron the Dhakaani placed these fierce figures on fortresses. However,
      gargoyles don’t have to have horns or wings, and they can alter their form
      over time. Gargoyles reproduce by imbuing a sliver of their life force
      into a stone and burying it in gravel; this seed assimilates mass from the
      loose stone and builds its final form.</p><p>Gargoyles have no need of
      food or drink. They are nearly immune to the passage of time and can
      remain standing still indefinitely. For any gargoyle, a fundamental
      question is why they choose to move at all. What drives them? There are a
      few common archetypes. Seekers are driven by curiosity, and love seeing
      new places and learning new things. Guardians devote themselves to
      protecting a person, place, or concept. Movers enjoy motion itself—flight,
      fighting, dancing—and often become scouts or soldiers. Thinkers are rarely
      seen, because they have the least reason to actually move; they live to
      ponder philosophies and ideas. A statue in a temple or a library could be
      a gargoyle priest or sage, lost in contemplation.</p>
