  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are a Simeq - an aquatic cousin of the drow created by the giants
      to act as oceanic scouts and warriors. Your people are marked by their
      ties to Lamannia, granting them animal features, and the ability to change
      their forms as they age. The Simeq live in the Phoenix Basin, claiming the
      ruins of the ancient Sul’at city of Simeq Riva. Here, they have
      established a thriving home both above and below the waves, trading with
      the people of the oceans and the land. Simeq culture is marked by
      mutability; changing one’s form is seen as fashion, while the elves make
      use of bioengineered creatures for their technology. Some Simeq take this
      a step further, perfecting their art until they can take on the
      appearances of others at will. These ‘tidelings’ often act as spies and
      merchants beyond the Phoenix Basin. Other Simeq find their calling as
      adventurers; the lost ruins of the Sul’at League hold many magebreeding
      techniques of value to your society, while others have heard the call for
      greater evolution in their dreams, pulling them towards land…</p><p>Simeq
      stand around five and a half feet tall, with a fair degree of variance,
      with their build depending on the form they adopt. They reach physical
      maturity at the same age as humans, but can live up to 750
      years.</p><p>When creating a Simeq character, consider:</p><ol><li>What is
      your preferred form, and why?</li><li>How do you see those who cannot
      change their forms so easily?</li><li>How do you see the growing powers
      around your people</li><li>the ships of the Unity of Riedra to the south,
      and the Eternal Dominion to the north?</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>.
      You are Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed is
      30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking
      speed.</p><p><strong>Amphibious</strong>. You can breathe air and
      water.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Fey Ancestry</strong>. You have advantage on saving
      throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to
      sleep.</p><p><strong>Trance</strong>. Elves do not sleep. Instead they
      meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common
      word for this meditation is "trance." While meditating, you dream after a
      fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become
      reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the
      same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.</p><p><strong>Oceanic
      Transmutation</strong>. Your body can be altered with oceanic
      characteristics due to the ancient Sul’at League. You choose one
      transmutation now and one at 5th level:</p><ul><li><strong>Extremophile
      (1st level).</strong> You have resistance to either cold or fire damage,
      which you choose between when you finish a long
      rest.</li><li><strong>Manta Glide (1st level).</strong> You have ray-like
      fins that you use as wings to slow your fall or allow you to glide. When
      you fall and are not incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from
      your fall when calculating your fall damage and can move horizontally 2
      feet for every 1 foot you fall.</li><li><strong>Nimble Climber (1st
      level).</strong> You have a climb speed equal to your walk
      speed.</li><li><strong>Grappling Appendages (5th level).</strong> You have
      two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're
      both claws or tentacles. You can use these appendages to grapple a
      creature. Each one is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make an
      unarmed strike with. On a hit, they deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 +
      your Strength modifier. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple
      the target as a bonus action. These appendages are not dexterous enough to
      use weapons, magic weapons, and other specialized
      equipment.</li><li><strong>Carapace (5th level).</strong> Your skin in
      places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 to your AC when not
      wearing heavy armor.</li><li><strong>Acid Spit (5th level).</strong> When
      you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your
      attacks by spraying acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature
      or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a
      Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 8 + you proficiency bonus + your
      Constitution modifier. The target takes 2d10 acid damage on a failure, or
      half on a success. The damage increases to 3d10 at 11th level and 4d10 at
      17th level.</li></ul><p>Simeq names are derived from Elvish with Giant
