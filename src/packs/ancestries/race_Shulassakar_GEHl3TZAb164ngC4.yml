  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are a shulassakar - a divine warrior of the couatl, marked by
      prismatic serpentine features and rainbow feathers. Your people, once
      human, were blessed by the couatl with divine form and power. They have
      battled evil and protected ancient ruins since the Age of Demons. The
      serpentfolk dwell within a Khyber demiplane known as Hope’s Meridian, and
      journey out across the world to serve the Silver Flame. In Xen’drik, the
      shulassakar help to monitor the land for signs of the Overlord’s release.
      Sometimes this means infiltrating cities such as Stormreach; others act as
      emissaries to the hidden city of Bazek Mohl, training and communing with
      the couatl that protects it. As a shulassakar, your mission is vital, your
      blade destined to cut down evil - but evil never sleeps. What prophecy or
      portent now drives your mission?</p><p>When playing a Shulassakar
      character, consider:</p><ol><li>Were you given a specific duty by Hope’s
      Meridian, and if so, what is it?</li><li>Are you an experienced warrior
      returning to the battlefield after a period of rest, or are you a young
      hopeful yet to test your mettle?</li><li>Are you comfortable with your
      isolation, or do you feel pulled to comrades who fight the good
      fight?</li><li>Do you enjoy Xen’drik and your station, or do you miss the
      arcadian fortress of Hope’s Meridian? Originally created by Luke
      Robinson</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>: You are Medium or Small. You
      choose the size when you select this race.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>:
      You have a speed of 30 ft.</p><p><strong>Couatl Magic</strong>. You know
      the sacred flame cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast cure wounds
      with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast lesser
      restoration with this trait. Once you cast cure wounds or lesser
      restoration with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until
      you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any
      spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them
      with this trait (choose when you select this race). None of these spells
      require spell components when you cast them with this
      trait.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
      Poison Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid
      or end the poisoned condition on yourself. You also have resistance to
      poison damage.</p><p><strong>Psionic Mind</strong>. You can speak
      telepathically to any creature you can see, provided the creature is
      within a number of feet of you equal to 10 times your level. You don't
      need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your
      telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at
      least one language.</p><p>Shulassakar names draw on the Celestial
      language, as well as the now-extinct Khaleshi language of
      Sarlona.</p><p><strong>Names</strong>: Sesstaria, Danassa, Ralkasaan,
      Isteria, Solaihir, Veqtakir, Kastell</p>
