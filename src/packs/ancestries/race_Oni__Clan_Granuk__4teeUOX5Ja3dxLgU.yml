      <p>The ogres of Boranun once bound many types of fiends to their
      bloodlines, creating the first oni. Once upon a time, these oni lines were
      once formed into great clans, and you carry a spark of that ancient
      legacy. Borunan oni stand between 6-8 feet tall depending on their
      fiendish origin and weigh between 200-400 pounds. Oni reach adulthood at
      20 and live up to 150 years.</p><p>A powerful bone devil commander was
      captured and bound to your bloodline. The oni of Clan Granuk are pale,
      with bony plates over sections of their body and razorsharp claws. Many
      once served on the frontlines of Gul Dol as masters of unarmed
      combat.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>: Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Bone Plating</strong>. Sections of your skin are
      covered in bony plates. While you arenâ€™t wearing armor, your base Armor
      Class is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p><p><strong>Fiendish
      Resistance</strong>. Your devil heritage gives you resistance to poison
      damage and advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the poisoned
      condition on yourself.</p><p><strong>Natural Weapons</strong>. Your hands
      end in sharp talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit
      with them, the attack deals slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength
      modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed
      strike.</p><p><strong>Powerful Build</strong>. You count as one size
      larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can
      push, drag, or lift.</p>
