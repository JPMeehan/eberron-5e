  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are one of the elusive spiderfolk of the forests of Dread Lake.
      Once servants of the Spinner of Shadows, now free to make their own
      destiny, your people have lived in secrecy for millennia. Their fearsome
      appearance is a source of myth and legends for others. You might have the
      form of a drider, chitine, or drow with spidery features. Your people are
      skilled in stealth and illusion, but growing threats such as the Crawling
      Queen may have brought you bravely into the light.</p><p>When creating a
      Child of the Mist, consider:</p><ol><li>How do you feel about people
      seeing your true appearance?</li><li>Do you feel excitement or trepidation
      about leaving your hidden home?</li><li>What has caused you to adventure
      into the surrounding lands?</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>. You are
      Small or Medium, which you choose when you select this
      ancestry.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed is 30
      feet, and you have a climb speed equal to your walking
      speed.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Secondary Arms</strong>. You have two slightly smaller
      secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms
      function like your primary arms, but cannot wield a shield, or a weapon
      without the light property.</p><p><strong>Spider Climb</strong>. At 3rd
      level, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down
      along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.</p><p>Spinner’s Webs. You
      can cast disguise self with this trait. When you cast disguise self in
      this way, you can hide your secondary arms. Starting at 3rd level, you can
      cast the web spell with this trait. Once you cast either of these spells
      with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you
      complete a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots
      you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is
      your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this
      trait, which you choose when you select this ancestry.</p><p>Mistfolk
      names are originally derived from ancient Infernal, and can have sounds
      intended to be spoken by those with arachnid mouthparts. Between
      themselves, these names are conveyed via pheromones, and speaking them
      aloud to strangers can take some getting used to.</p><p>Names: Kitashr,
      Vekjai, Ikkisek, Takress, Sasares, Zjas</p>
