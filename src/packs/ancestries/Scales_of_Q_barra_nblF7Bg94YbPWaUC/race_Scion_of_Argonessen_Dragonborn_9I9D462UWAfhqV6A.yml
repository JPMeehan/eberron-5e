      <p class="5E-COREBODYPARA1">Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety
      of traits you share with other dragonborn.</p><p
      class="5E-COREBODYPARA2"><em><strong>Suggested Ability Score
      Increase.</strong></em> Your Charisma score increases by 1. (The other +2
      comes from your subrace)</p><p
      class="5E-COREBODYPARA2"><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Young dragonborn
      grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and
      development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach
      adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</p><p
      class="5E-COREBODYPARA2"><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Dragonborn are
      taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and
      averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p
      class="5E-COREBODYPARA2"><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base
      walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p
      class="5E-COREBODYPARA2"><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can
      speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one
      of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The
      language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard
      consonants and sibilants.</p><h5>Breath

      Weapon.</strong></em> You can use your bonus action to exhale destructive
      energy. Choose a damage type from the Breath Weapon table. In addition,
      choose whether your breath weapon manifests in a 15 ft. cone or a 5 by 30
      ft. line. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of
      the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined
      by your choice on the Breath Weapon table. The DC for this saving throw
      equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature
      takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful
      one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 9th level, 5d6 at
      13th level, and 6d6 at 17th level.</p><p>After you use your breath weapon,
      you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long
      rest.</p><p><em><strong>Limited Flight.</strong></em> You have a flight
      speed of 30 feet. In addition, whenever you start your turn flying, you
      have disadvantage on attack rolls and enemies have advantage on saving
      throws against your spells until you land. </p><p><em><strong>Natural
      Armor.</strong></em> You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren’t wearing
      armor, your AC is 11 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural
      armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a
      lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural
      armor.</p>
