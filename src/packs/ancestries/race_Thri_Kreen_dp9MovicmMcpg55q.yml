    value: >-
      <p>You are a thri-kreen, touched by the Plane of Dreams. It is said that
      thri-kreen see into the plane at all times, shaping their ephemeral
      viewpoints of life and death. Over their history, the thri-kreen have
      built empires and created wonders of great power, but few remain; the
      disaster that befell the hive-city built where modern Stormreach now
      stands is a deep taboo. The thri-kreen of the Skyfall Peninsula are lithe
      and camouflaged, well-suited for their jungle home. In comparison, the
      Ikat-takt ('Titanshells')of the Scimitar Spires are bulky and
      thick-shelled, resembling beetles more than mantids. The Kapaerian Islands
      are instead home to the oracular Dre’kalak ('Death's Head'), who believe
      themselves to lie in the intersection between life’s dream and the
      nightmare of death.</p><p>Thri-kreen stand between 5-6 foot tall, except
      for the Dre’kalak, who are instead between 3-4 foot. Regardless of
      subrace, thri-kreen mature by age 6, and rarely live beyond 30.</p><p>When
      creating a thri-kreen character, consider:</p><ol><li>How do you see the
      ‘sleep’ and dreams of other mortals?</li><li>With your short lifespan,
      what is your view on death?</li><li>What do you hope to achieve by
      becoming an adventurer?</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>. You are Medium
      or Small. You choose the size when you select this
      race.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Chameleon Carapace</strong>. While you aren’t wearing
      armor, your carapace gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity
      modifier. As an action, you can change the color of your carapace to match
      the color and texture of your surroundings, giving you advantage on
      Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in those
      surroundings.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light
      within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it
      were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Secondary Arms</strong>. You have two slightly smaller
      secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms
      function like your primary arms, but cannot wield a shield, or a weapon
      without the light property.</p><p><strong>Sleepless
      Revitalization</strong>. You do not require sleep and can choose to remain
      conscious during a long rest, though you must still refrain from strenuous
      activity to gain the benefit of the rest.</p><p>Thri-kreen Telepathy. You
      have the magical ability to communicate mentally with any number of
      willing creatures you can see within 120 feet of you. A contacted creature
      doesn’t need to share a language with you, but it must be able to
      understand at least one language. Your telepathic link to a creature is
      broken if you and the creature move more than 120 feet apart, if either of
      you is incapacitated, or if either of you mentally breaks the contact (no
      action required).</p><p>Thri-kreen names are naturally derived from their
      language, and contain consonants meant to be pronounced with insectoid
      mouthparts.</p><p><strong>Names</strong>: Tak’ikt, Ik-chal, Nakt, Kultil,
      Than-ik’ti, Chathak, Ptikal, Chachat’ka, Drulnat</p>
