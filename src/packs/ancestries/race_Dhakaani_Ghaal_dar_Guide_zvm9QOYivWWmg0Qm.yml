      <p>Dhakaani hobgoblins are known as ghaal’dar, “mighty folk”— not to be
      confused with the Ghaal’dar tribes that dominate Darguun. The ghaal’dar
      are soldiers, scholars, and leaders, valued for their versatility and
      their vision. Your ghaal’dar character has the following
      traits.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Ghaal’dar mature at the same
      rate as humans and have lifespans similar to
      theirs.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Ghaal’dar are between 5 and
      6 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 200 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You can see in dim
      light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as
      if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><em><strong>Discipline.</strong></em> You have advantage on
      saving throws against being
      charmed.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read,
      and write Common and Goblin.</p><p><em><strong>Lead By

      can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see
      within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you
      can’t use it again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p><p><em><strong>The Guiding Arts.</strong></em> You have
