      <p>You are a scaled ara’sihei - a ‘child of the sun’. Your people can be
      found across Xen’drik, from the waterways of the Hydra to the glacial
      Thunderwall. Unlike Q’barra, the ‘lizardfolk’ of Xen’drik are not united
      under a single culture by the couatl, and have a variety of different
      forms and beliefs. You might be lithe and camouflaged like the
      Shiftscales, spined and adapted to desert heat like the Nektari, or large
      and feathered like the behemoth dinosaurs of your home. As an ara’sihei,
      the moods and shifting expressions of the scaleless can be hard to
      interpret at first, just as they struggle to interpret your body language
      and shifting colors. Xen’drik has many threats both old and new, and
      ara’sihei adventurers can often be found working in service to their
      people.</p><p>When creating an ara’sihei character,
      consider:</p><ol><li>In lieu of facial expressions, how do you convey your
      mood and emotions?</li><li>You can go for up to a week without eating a
      large meal; when you do, how do you treat your relationship to
      food?</li><li>How do you deal with uncomfortably cold temperatures before
      you have time to warm up</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>: You are Medium
      or Small. You choose the size when you select this
      race.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Bite</strong>. You have a fanged maw that you can use
      to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals
      1d6</p><ul><li>your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the
      bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed
      strike.</li></ul><p><strong>Desert Adaptation</strong>. You are immune to
      the effects of extreme heat, and only need to drink water once every two
      weeks. Additionally, you gain proficiency in
      Survival.</p><p><strong>Natural Armor</strong>. While you aren’t wearing
      armor, your scaly skin gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity
      modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor
      you wear would leave you with a lower AC.</p><p><strong>Spined
      Scales</strong>. You can flare your scales, raising spines against
      aggressors as a bonus action. Until you end the effect as a bonus action,
      any creature that strikes you with its body or an unarmed attack, attempts
      to grapple you, or begins its turn grappling you, takes piercing damage
      equal to your proficiency modifier. Additionally, you gain advantage on
      Charisma (Intimidation) ability checks</p><p>Lizardfolk have secondary
      names shared between clutchmates, based on the events of their
      hatching.</p><p><strong>Names</strong>: Ghruzh, Aktesh, Ihathu, Sesk,
      Ara’saz, Thrijast, Ukathsi, Aqelka</p><p><strong>Clutch Names</strong>:
      Dark Sky, Sun Tide, Year of Plenty, Grand Hunt, River Song, Sky Fall</p>
