      <p>While lizardfolk inhabit many places in Eberron, the influence of the
      couatl dreams have given the lizardfolk of Q’barra variant
      statistics</p><p><em><strong>Suggested Ability Score
      Increase.</strong></em> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your
      Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em>
      Lizardfolk reach maturity around age 14 and rarely live longer than 60
      years.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Lizardfolk are a little
      bulkier and taller than humans, and their colorful frills make them appear
      even larger. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em>
      Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed of 30
      feet.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and
      write Common and Draconic.</p><p><em><strong>Whipping Tail.</strong></em>
      Your powerful tail is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed
      strikes. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 +
      your Strength modifier, instead of the normal damage for an unarmed
      strike. When you take the Disengage action, you can make an attack with
      your tail as a bonus action.</p><p><em><strong>Hold Breath.</strong></em>
      You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a
      time.</p><p><em><strong>Dream Lore.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in
      one set of Artisan’s Tools and two of the following skills of your choice:
      Animal Handling, History, Insight, Nature, Perception, Religion, Stealth,
      and Survival.</p><p><em><strong>Ancient Artisan.</strong></em> Choose one
      set of artisan’s tools in which you have proficiency. You gain expertise
      with that tool, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
      ability check you make with it. The tool you choose must be one that isn’t
      already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your
      proficiency bonus.</p><p><em><strong>Natural Armor.</strong></em> You have
      tough, scaly skin. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your
      Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if
      the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits
      apply as normal while you use your natural armor. </p>
