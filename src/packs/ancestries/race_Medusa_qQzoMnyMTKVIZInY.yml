      <p>Medusas are infamous across Khorvaire for the deadly power of their
      petrifying gaze. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal are one of the most powerful
      forces within Droaam, renowned both for their remarkable stonework and
      their deep devotion to the Dark Six; the Cazhaak Creed has become the most
      widespread religion in Droaam. Medusas tend to be calm and calculating,
      useful traits when a single glance can have devastating
      consequences.</p><p>Medusa appearance varies by bloodline; some have
      scaled skin while at a glance others appear to be carved from stone. All
      medusas have a mane of writhing serpents, and they can use this mane to
      observe their surroundings even when they are blindfolded or have their
      main eyes closed. The petrifying gaze that medusa are famous for is
      something that develops over time. Young medusas have a weaker form known
      as the Gray Gaze, which eventually evolves into the Shadowswift Gaze that
      can petrify creatures in an instant.</p>
