      <p>Medusas are infamous across Khorvaire for the deadly power of their
      petrifying gaze. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal are one of the most powerful
      forces within Droaam, renowned both for their remarkable stonework and
      their deep devotion to the Dark Six; the Cazhaak Creed has become the most
      widespread religion in Droaam. Medusas tend to be calm and calculating,
      useful traits when a single glance can have devastating consequences.
      </p><p>Medusa appearance varies by bloodline; some have scaled skin while
      at a glance others appear to be carved from stone. All medusas have a mane
      of writhing serpents, and they can use this mane to observe their
      surroundings even when they are blindfolded or have their main eyes
      closed. The petrifying gaze that medusa are famous for is something that
      develops over time. Young medusas have a weaker form known as the Gray
      Gaze, which eventually evolves into the Shadowswift Gaze that can petrify
      creatures in an instant.</p>
