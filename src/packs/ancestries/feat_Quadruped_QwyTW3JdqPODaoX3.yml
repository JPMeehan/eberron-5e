    value: >-
      <p>You have several traits based on your quadrupedal body
      shape.</p><ul><li>You cannot hold items in your paws, and you cannot wield
      weapons or a Shield unless otherwise noted in the weaponâ€™s description
      (see Steel Jaws).</li><li>You can perform the Somatic components of spells
      with your front paws.</li><li>You have Disadvantage on ability checks that
      require fine manipulation.</li><li>You can carry a rider of Medium size or
      smaller. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying
      capacity.</li><li>You cannot wear armor designed for humanoids, you must
      wear barding instead. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for
      humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.</li><li>Any climb that requires
      hands is especially difficult for you. When you make such a climb, each
      foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra
      foot.</li></ul>
