  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are a locathah, an aquatic denizen of the oceans of Eberron. Spread
      far and wide across the seas, locathah are exceptionally adaptable, and
      live everywhere from the frozen Iceflow to the waterways of the Hydra.
      Different locathah have resistance to their environments, with varying
      appearances to match. In the Thunder Sea, the kingdoms of the Ewashah have
      been crushed by the Eternal Dominion, sending many into exile or refuge.
      To the south, the transparent Hathgashi live slow and die slower, carving
      cities out of the icebergs of their home. To the west, the ghostly
      Lurrshoi lurk within the Sea of Lost Souls, driving fear into Riedran
      sailors. Meanwhile, the continent’s interior is home to the Rushishi, with
      catfish barbels that let them see in the muddy waterways. The rarest of
      all are the sable Jahathah, who are said to live in the bones of dead
      leviathans at the very bottom of the sea. Their adaptability means that
      many locathah have an adventurous disposition, and are willing to roam far
      and wide in search of answers - or strength.</p><p>When creating a
      Locathah character, consider:</p><ol><li>What has driven you to adventure
      on land?</li><li>How do you see the bizarre life above the
      waves?</li><li>Is there anything you miss about life
      underwater?</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>: Locathah stand between 5-6
      feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base
      walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your
      walking speed. Amphibious. You can breathe air and
      water.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Piscine Form</strong>. You have advantage on saving
      throws and ability checks made to avoid or resist being grappled or
      restrained.</p><p><strong>Fisheye View</strong>. You have proficiency in
      the Perception skill.</p><p><strong>Natural Armor</strong>. You have
      tough, scaly skin. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your
      Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if
      the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits
      apply as normal while you use your natural
      armor.</p><p><strong>Resilient</strong>. You can reroll a saving throw
      that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use
      this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>Locathah family
      names are often geographical in nature, due to their penchant for
      exploring new seas.</p><p><strong>Names</strong>: Rishi, Haghawa, Ehuru,
      Sawar, Larhi, Gyar, Uori, Shoshi, Giroi, Gahasha</p><p><strong>Family
