      <p>As an Aereni elf, you were born into a world shaped by magic and honed
      by tradition. Whether you have a keen mind or are driven by deep faith,
      you’ve spent your youth perfecting one of the skills prized by your
      ancestors. </p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Although elves reach
      physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding
      of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience.
      An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100
      and can live to be 750 years
      old.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Elves love freedom,
      variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler
      aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their
      own, and they are more often good than
      not.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Elves range from under 5 to
      over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Accustomed to twilit
      forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim
      conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
      bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern
      color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Keen
      Senses.</strong></em> You have proficiency in the Perception
      skill.</p><p><em><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong></em> You have advantage on
      saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to
      sleep.</p><p><em><strong>Trance.</strong></em> Elves don't need to sleep.
      Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.
      (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you
      can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that
      have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this
      way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of
      sleep.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and
      write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and
      intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs
      and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so
      they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p><h5>Aereni
      Elf</h5><p>As an Aereni elf, you were born into a world shaped by magic
      and honed by tradition. Whether you have a keen mind or are driven by deep
      faith, you’ve spent your youth perfecting one of the skills prized by your
      ancestors.</p><p><em><strong>Aereni Expertise.</strong></em> Choose one
      skill or tool proficiency granted by your race, class, or background. Your
      proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using this
      chosen proficiency</p><p><em><strong>Cantrip.</strong></em> You know one
      cantrip of your choice from the cleric or wizard spell list. Your
      spellcasting ability depends on the class you chose: Wisdom for cleric or
      Intelligence for wizard.</p>
