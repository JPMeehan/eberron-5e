    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to awaken the power in
      your blood, causing a nimbus of crimson energy to flow out from
      you.</p><p>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a
      bonus action. During it, you shed dim light in a 10-foot radius, and at
      the end of each of your turns, one creature within 30 feet of you takes
      necrotic damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, if you
      or an ally within 30 feet drops to 0 hit points without being killed
      outright, you can use your reaction to preserve them, causing them to drop
      to 1 hit point instead. When you use this reaction, it ends your
      transformation early.</p><p>Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t use it
      again until you finish a long rest.</p>
