      humans.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. Blessed with a radiant soul, your
      vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60
      feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
      light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Celestial Resistance</strong>. You have resistance to
      necrotic damage and radiant damage.</p><p><strong>Healing Hands</strong>.
      As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of
      hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it
      again until you finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>Light Bearer</strong>.
      You know the light cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
      it.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>. You can speak, read, and write
      Common and Celestial.</p><p><strong>Shroud of Life and Death.</strong>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to awaken the power in your
      blood, causing a nimbus of crimson energy to flow out from you.</p><p>Your
      transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action.
      During it, you shed dim light in a 10-foot radius, and at the end of each
      of your turns, one creature within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage
      equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, if you or an ally
      within 30 feet drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, you
      can use your reaction to preserve them, causing them to drop to 1 hit
      point instead. When you use this reaction, it ends your transformation
      early.</p><p>Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
