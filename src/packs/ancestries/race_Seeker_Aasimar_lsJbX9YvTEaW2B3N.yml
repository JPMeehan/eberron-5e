      light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Celestial Resistance</strong>. You have resistance to
      necrotic damage and radiant damage.</p><p><strong>Healing Hands</strong>.
      As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of

      it.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>. You can speak, read, and write

      as a bonus action. During it, you shed dim light in a 10-foot radius, and
      at the end of each of your turns, one creature within 30 feet of you takes
      necrotic damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, if you
      or an ally within 30 feet drops to 0 hit points without being killed
      outright, you can use your reaction to preserve them, causing them to drop
      to 1 hit point instead. When you use this reaction, it ends your
      transformation early.</p><p>Once you use this trait, you can’t use it
      again until you finish a long rest.</p>
