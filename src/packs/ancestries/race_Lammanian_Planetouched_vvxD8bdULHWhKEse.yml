      <p>Unbridled and unbound nature has left its mark upon you. Celestial
      animals guide aasimar, known for befriending those they meet along the way
      with hawk-like eyes and intricate leaf-like hair. Lamannian genasi look
      like the nature spirits and elementals of the plane, skin textured like
      bark and hair like great bushes or flowers. While there are few fiends
      within Lamannia, tieflings sport great branching horns, sharp teeth, and
      long claws. Creature Type. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>: If you replace a species with this
      lineage, use your species to determine your size. If you choose this
      lineage at character creation, you are Medium or Small. You choose the
      size when you select this lineage.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Your base
      walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Ancestral Legacy</strong>. If you
      replace a species with this lineage, you can keep the following elements
      of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing,
      flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.</p><p>If you don't keep any
      of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you
      gain proficiency in two skills of your
      choice.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Natural Resilience</strong>. You are naturally
      acclimated to extreme heat, extreme cold, and high altitudes, including
      elevations over 20,000 feet. Additionally, you have resistance to poison
      damage and you have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end
      the poisoned condition on yourself.</p><p><strong>Planetouched
      Nature</strong>. When you choose this lineage, choose the nature of your
      planar tie to Lamannia: Celestial, Elemental, or Fiendish. Your choice
      grants you one of the traits
      below:</p><p><em><strong>Celestial</strong></em>. You can cast the animal
      friendship and goodberry spells with this trait. Once you cast either of
      these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again
      until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any
      spell slots you have.</p><p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your
      spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait
      (choose when you select this
      race).</p><p><em><strong>Elemental</strong></em>. You can hold your breath
      indefinitely while you’re not incapacitated, and you can move across
      difficult terrain without expending extra movement if you are using your
      walking speed on the ground or a floor. Additionally, you can breathe air
      and water, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking
      speed.</p><p><em><strong>Fiendish</strong></em>. You know the primal
      savagery (see Chapter 12) cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the
      ensnaring strike spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can
      also cast the spike growth spell with this trait. Once you cast ensnaring
      strike or spike growth with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it
      again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those
      spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate
      level.</p><p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting
      ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when
      you select this lineage)</p>
