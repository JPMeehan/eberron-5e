      <p>The daelkyr have corrupted Sardior, but you do not think that has to be
      the end for your people. This material world is not yours, but it makes a
      fine enough home for now. As a githzerai, you would rather make do with
      the world you have been given â€” either to make it into a home for your
      descendants or to remake via psionic will into the lost Sardior. The
      githzerai are often on better terms with Adarans as a whole, respecting
      their discipline and bent towards monastic life.</p><p><strong>Creature
      Type</strong>. You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. You are
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Githzerai Psionics</strong>. You know the mage hand
      cantrip, and the hand is invisible when you cast the cantrip with this
      trait.</p><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the shield spell with
      this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the detect thoughts
      spell with it. Once you cast shield or detect thoughts spell with this
      trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long
      rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you
      have of the appropriate level.</p><p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is
      your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this
      trait (choose when you select this race). None of these spells require
      spell components when you cast them with this trait.</p><p><strong>Mental
      Discipline</strong>. Your innate psychic defenses grant you advantage on
      saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed and frightened
      conditions on yourself. Psychic Resilience. You have resistance to psychic
      damage</p>
