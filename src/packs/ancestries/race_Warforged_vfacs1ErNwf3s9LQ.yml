      <p>Your warforged character has the following traits. A few of the traits
      give you a choice; consider how your choice reflects the purpose for which
      your character was built.</p><p><em><strong>Age. </strong></em>A typical
      warforged is between two and thirty years old. The maximum warforged
      lifespan remains a mystery; so far, warforged have shown no signs of
      deterioration due to age. You are immune to magical aging
      effects.</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are a
      Construct.</p><p><em><strong>Size. </strong></em>Your size is Medium. To
      set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size
      modifier:</p><p style="text-align:center">Size modifier = 2d6</p><p
      style="text-align:center">Height = 5 feet + 10 inches + your size modifier
      in inches</p><p style="text-align:center">Weight in pounds = 270 + (4 ×
      your size modifier)</p><p><em><strong>Speed. </strong></em>Your base
      walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Constructed Resilience.
      </strong></em>You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented
      by the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You have advantage on saving
      throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison
      damage.</p></li><li><p>You don’t need to eat, drink, or
      breathe.</p></li><li><p>You are immune to disease.</p></li><li><p>You
      don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to
      sleep.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Living Construct.</strong></em> The
      livewood and alchemical fluids in your body allow you to benefit from
      several spells that preserve life but normally don’t affect Constructs:
      <em>cure wounds, healing word, mass cure wounds, mass healing word,
      </em>and <em>spare the dying</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Sentry’s Rest.
      </strong></em>When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours
      in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you
      appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and
      hear as normal.</p><p><em><strong>Integrated Protection.
      </strong></em>Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be
      enhanced with armor:</p><ul><li><p>You gain a +1 bonus to Armor
      Class.</p></li><li><p>You can don only armor with which you have
      proficiency. To don armor other than a shield, you must incorporate it
      into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you remain in
      contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it.
      You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this
      way.</p></li><li><p>While you live, the armor incorporated into your body
      can’t be removed against your
      will.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Specialized Design. </strong></em>You
      gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your
      choice.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read,
      and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p>
