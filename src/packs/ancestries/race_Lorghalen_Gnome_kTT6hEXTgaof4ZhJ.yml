      <p>Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all
      other gnomes.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Gnomes mature at the
      same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult
      life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500
      years.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Gnomes are most often
      good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers,
      scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are
      minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are
      goodâ€‘hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than
      vicious.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Gnomes are between 3 and 4
      feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is
      Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      25 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Accustomed to life
      underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
      see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
      darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness,
      only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Gnome Cunning.</strong></em> You
      have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws
      against magic.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak,
      read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the
      Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs
      of knowledge about the natural world.</p><h5>Lorghalen
      Gnome</h5><p>Lorghalan gnomes are known more for their charisma than their
      intellect, and for working with nature as opposed to weaving
      illusions.</p><p><em><strong>Song of the Elements.</strong></em> You know
      the <em>druidcraft</em> cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
      it. In addition, you can speak, read, and write
      Primordial.</p><p><em><strong>Speak with Small
      Beasts.</strong></em><strong> </strong>Through sounds and gestures, you
      can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts. Forest gnomes
      love animals and often keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles,
      woodpeckers, and other creatures as beloved pets.</p>
