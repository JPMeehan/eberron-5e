  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are bound to an alien entity. It’s part of your body and can’t be
      removed. Your symbiont possesses a minor supernatural ability, which it
      can use on your behalf.</p><p>Choose a cantrip from the following list:
      acid splash, guidance (self only), infestation, light, mage hand, poison
      spray, ray of frost. As long as your personal symbiont is fully exposed,
      you can cast that cantrip. You can choose to conceal the symbiont, but you
      can only cast the cantrip you gain with this trait while it’s
      exposed.</p><p>When you finish a long rest, you can mutate the symbiont,
      gaining different benefits; when you do so, you can select a different
      cantrip from this list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this
      cantrip.</p><p>Work with your DM to determine the appearance of your
      symbiont. It is organic and clearly alien, and when you cast a cantrip
      with this trait, it should be obvious that the symbiont is the source. A
      symbiont that casts mage hand could be a thin tentacle or an ectoplasmic
      insect that emerges from your body and performs the action. An eyestalk
      protruding from your shoulder could grant you guidance as it studies the
      situation and telepathically advises you—or it might blast your enemies
      with a ray of frost. Infestation could reflect a cloud of insects always
      hovering around you.</p>
