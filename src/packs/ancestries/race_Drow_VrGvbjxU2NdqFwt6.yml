    value: >-
      <p>You are one of Xen’drik’s drow, first created as planetouched servants
      and assassins for the ancient giants. Freed from servitude, your people
      have reclaimed Xen'drik in the ages since, diversifying into a rainbow of
      cultures and beliefs. The Vulkooridal and Qaltiar are primal practitioners
      who revere the spirits of nature. In contrast, the Súlatar worship
      different aspects of divine fire, from the Silver Flame, to the angels of
      Fernia, to the archfiend known as the Burning Desire. Above, the skybound
      Ko use their talent for flight magic to live on floating islands and
      earthbergs, safe from the dangers below.</p><p>Drow stand around five and
      a half feet tall, with a fair degree of variance, and tend towards slender
      builds. They reach physical maturity at the same age as humans, but can
      live up to 750 years.</p><p>When creating a drow character,
      consider:</p><ol><li>How do you see your people’s history with the
      giants?</li><li>How do you see those drow with the opposite view of the
      giants to you?</li><li>What is your opinion or experience of your kin
      across the sea - especially those Silaes Tairn who return to the land they
      fled?</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Fey Ancestry</strong>. You have advantage on saving
      throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
      Additionally, you know the Elvish language, although most drow are only
      familiar with the signed form.</p><p><strong>Light Show</strong>. You know
      the dancing lights cantrip and can cast it without material
      components.</p><p><strong>Superior Darkvision</strong>. Drow are a
      nocturnal people, and their eyes are adapted to such conditions. You can
      see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
      darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness,
      only shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>. You have
      disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
      sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to
      perceive is in direct sunlight.</p><p><strong>Trance</strong>. Drow, like
      all elves, don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining
      semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you craft your own
      dreams; these are creations of the material world, and as such your spirit
      does not visit Dal Quor. After resting this way, you gain the same benefit
      that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p><p><strong>Feat</strong>. You
      gain one feat of your choice for which you qualify.</p><p>Names: Zúlajé,
      Holúar, Shen’kar, Ax’ayúma, Ad’rúl, Xan’torra, Ek’ann</p><p>Family:
      Xiv’inn, Tokazz, Gen’thac, Xar’cha, Kúlaj, Geléma</p>
