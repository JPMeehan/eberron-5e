    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine
      energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness
      and two skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The
      instant you transform, other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see
      you must each succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency
      bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end
      of your next turn.</p><p>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until
      you end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you
      can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it
      with an attack or a spell. The extra necrotic damage equals your
      level.</p><p>Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t use it again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
