      <p>Goliaths—better known as eneko, or Children of the Sand—are found in
      the Syrkarn deserts and steppes of Sarlona. Many outsiders say the eneko
      descended from the ogres of Borunan and the humans of the steppes.
      However, the eneko say their roots run deeper, claiming they carry the
      blood of giants who roamed the desert long before the rise of any human
      civilization.</p><p><em><strong>Age. </strong></em>Eneko have lifespans
      comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually
      live less than a century.</p><p><em><strong>Size. </strong></em>Eneko are
      between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size
      is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><em><strong>Little Giant.</strong></em> You have proficiency
      in the Athletics skill, and you count as one size larger when determining
      your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or
      lift.</p><p><em><strong>Stone’s Endurance. </strong></em>You can
      supernaturally draw on unyielding stone to shrug off harm. When you take
      damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution
      modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that
      total.</p><p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long
      rest.</p><p><em><strong>Desert Born.</strong></em> You have resistance to
      fire damage. You also naturally acclimate to hot climates and aren’t
      adversely affected by extreme heat.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.
