      <p>Goliaths—better known as eneko, or Children of the Sand—are found in
      the Syrkarn deserts and steppes of Sarlona. Many outsiders say the eneko
      descended from the ogres of Borunan and the humans of the steppes.
      However, the eneko say their roots run deeper, claiming they carry the
      blood of giants who roamed the desert long before the rise of any human
      civilization.</p><p><em><strong>Age. </strong></em>Eneko have lifespans
      comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually
      live less than a century.</p><p><em><strong>Size. </strong></em>Eneko are
      between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size
      is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed. </strong></em>Your base walking speed

      When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your
      Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that
      total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a
      short or long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Powerful Build. </strong></em>You
      count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the
      weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p><p><em><strong>Desert

      acclimate to hot climates and aren’t adversely affected by extreme
