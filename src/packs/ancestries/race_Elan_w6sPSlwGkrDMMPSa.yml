      <p><strong>Age</strong>. The process to transform a humanoid into an elan
      can only be performed on an adult, so newly created elans have the
      physical form and general mental faculties of a mature humanoid from the
      instant they are created. Elans do not age, and they only expire from
      accident or violence. You are immune to magical aging
      effects.</p><p><strong>Alignment</strong>. Elans are created as blank
      slates, with no part of their former personality or memory intact. They
      tend toward no particular alignment, but their experiences immediately
      following their creation by the Inspired can color their outlook for the
      rest of their immortal lives.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. The Dreaming
      Dark typically chooses humans to create elans from, and the process gives
      the subject’s body a slightly emaciated form. Your size is Medium. To set
      your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier.</p><p
      style="text-align:center">Size modifier = 2d10</p><p
      style="text-align:center">Height = 4 feet + 8 inches + your size modifier
      in inches</p><p style="text-align:center">Weight in pounds = 100 + (1d6 x
      your size modifier)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed
      is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Naturally Psionic</strong>. You gain an internal
      reserve of psionic energy represented by psi points. Your psi point
      maximum is 2, or your existing psi point maximum from another source (such
      as levels in a class with the Psionics feature) increases by 2. When you
      reach 5th level, your psi point maximum increases by an additional
      2.</p><p>All expended psi points are restored when you finish a long rest.
      Your psi limit is 2, and when you reach 5th level your psi limit increases
      to 4, if it is not already higher.</p><p><strong>Psionic
      Endurance</strong>. When you take damage, you can spend psi points as a
      reaction to reduce the damage by an amount equal to twice the number of
      psi points spent (obeying your psi limit). After you use this trait, you
      can’t use it again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p><p><strong>Psionic Metabolism</strong>. You have no need to
      breathe, eat, or sleep provided that you have at least one unspent psi
      point. To gain the benefits of a long rest while benefiting from this
      trait, you can spend 8 hours engaged in light activity, rather than
      sleeping.</p><p><strong>Psionic Resilience</strong>. When you make a
      saving throw, you can spend 2 psi points as a reaction to gain a +5 bonus
      on all saving throws until the start of your next turn. After you use this
      trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long
      rest.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>. You can speak, read, and write
      Riedran and one extra language of your choice.</p>
