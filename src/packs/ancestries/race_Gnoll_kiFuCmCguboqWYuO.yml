      <p>Fierce and feral, the first gnolls were hyenas infused with malefic
      power by archfiends of war and the wild. They were created as cruel
      soldiers to serve in the endless conflicts of fiends, but over the course
      of countless generations a number of gnoll clans broke their ties to their
      demon overlords. These free gnolls are fiercely loyal to their pack and
      their clan, and serve as a stabilizing force within Droaam.</p><p>Gnolls
      that are bound to the overlords are vicious and wild. Those who have
      escaped this bondage still have a fiendish spark within, but they contain
      and control this power. Some learn to wield it as Warlocks. Others known
      as hwyri train to fight demons and other supernatural threats. Even free
      gnolls can be aggressive, but they are gifted hunters and fiercely loyal
      to those they choose as family.</p><hr /><p>Centuries ago, the gnolls of
      the Znir Pact turned their backs on the worship of fiends, resolving to
      live as free people. Chapter 4 discusses their role in Droaam and across
      the land of Khorvaire. Your gnoll character has the following racial
      traits.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Young gnolls grow with
      uncanny speed. A gnoll is capable of fending for itself after only a few
      months, and is considered an adult at 5 years of age. Gnolls live to be
      around 30 years old. They remain vigorous until the end; death by old age
      is marked by a catastrophic decline over a space of a few days. Many
      believe this unusual lifecycle is tied to the supernatural origins of the
      gnoll.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Gnolls are between 7 and 8
      feet tall and weigh between 250 to 320 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You can see in dim
      light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as
      if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><em><strong>Bite.</strong></em> Your teeth are natural
      weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with your
      bite, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier,
      instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed
      strike.</p><p><em><strong>Hunter’s Senses.</strong></em> You gain
      proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Perception,
      Stealth or Survival.</p><p><em><strong>Rampage.</strong></em> On your
      turn, when you make an unarmed strike using your bite attack or reduce a
      creature to 0 hit points with an attack, you can use a bonus action to
      move up to half your speed and make a weapon attack or bite
      attack.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read,
      and write Gnoll, and your choice of either Common or Goblin.</p>
