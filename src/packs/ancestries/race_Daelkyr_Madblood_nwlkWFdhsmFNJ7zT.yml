    value: >-
      <p><strong>Age</strong>. Daelkyr madbloods mature at the same rate as
      humans but do not generally live as long, since they are more likely to
      suffer from degenerative health conditions in the twilight of their
      lives.</p><p><strong>Alignment</strong>. Daelkyr madbloods must always
      fight vile thoughts that may or may not be their own. They tend toward
      evil, and are usually neutral at best, but it is not impossible for an
      exceptional individual to find comfort in altruism and become good. In any
      case, their roiling madness almost always tends toward chaotic
      alignments.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Daelkyr madbloods are built much
      like humans but typically appear a little sickly. Your size is Medium. To
      set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size
      modifier.</p><p style="text-align:center">Size modifier = 2d4</p><p
      style="text-align:center">Height = 5 feet + 1 inches + your size modifier
      in inches</p><p style="text-align:center">Weight in pounds = 105 + (1d6 x
      your size modifier)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed
      is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Aberrant</strong>. Your body might appear to be
      humanoid, but something about your presence is anathema to natural
      creatures. You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill, and your
      proficiency bonus is doubled on all Charisma (Intimidation) checks you
      make to influence humanoids.</p><p>However, you also have disadvantage on
      Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to influence humanoids if you do not
      have proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and on Wisdom (Animal Handling)
      checks if you do not have proficiency in the Animal Handling
      skill.</p><p><strong>Touched by Madness.</strong> You know one of the
      following psionic talents: energy ray, primal metabolism, or wild talent.
      Once you reach 3rd level, you learn one 1st-level psionic power of your
      choice that augments the talent you selected for this trait. Once you
      reach 5th level, you learn another 1st-level psionic power of your choice
      that augments the talent you selected for this trait. Charisma is your
      psionic ability for these powers.</p><p>Whenever you manifest or cast a
      psionic power granted by this trait, roll a d20. On a roll of 20, you
      manifest the power as normal and immediately regain any psi points you
      spent to manifest it, if any. On a roll of 1, the power fails and each
      creature within a 10- foot radius sphere centered on you takes 2d4 psychic
      damage. This damage increases by 1d4 whenever your proficiency bonus
      increases. On any other roll, the power manifests as
      normal.</p><p><strong>Naturally Psionic</strong>. You gain an internal
      reserve of psionic energy represented by psi points. Your psi point
      maximum is 2, or your existing psi point maximum from another source (such
      as levels in a class with the Psionics feature) increases by 2. When you
      reach 5th level, your psi point maximum increases by an additional
      2.</p><p>All expended psi points are restored when you finish a long rest.
      Your psi limit is 2, and when you reach 5th level your psi limit increases
      to 4, if it is not already higher.</p><p><strong>Unbalanced Mind</strong>.
      Your mind is in constant self-revolt and contact with it can be
      debilitating. Any creature that attempts to read your thoughts, study your
      mind, or make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine information about you
      suffers disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saves until the
      end of their next turn.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>. You can speak,
      read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice</p>
