      <p><strong>Age</strong>. Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans.
      They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a
      century. Alignment. Goliaths that are born dreamscarred either tend toward
      the same lawful social norms as their tribe, or rebel from them as a
      reaction to being shunned, tending toward chaotic alignments in the latter
      case.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Dreamscarred goliaths stand just as
      tall as their “stoneborn” counterparts, but are typically slightly leaner.
      Your size is Medium. To set your height and weight randomly, start with
      rolling a size modifier.</p><p style="text-align:center">Size modifier =
      2d10</p><p style="text-align:center">Height = 6 feet + 2 inches + your
      size modifier in inches</p><p style="text-align:center">Weight in pounds =
      190 + (2d6 x your size modifier)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base
      walking speed is 30 feet. </p><p><strong>Dream of the Mountain.</strong>
      You know the verve psionic talent. Once you reach 3rd level, you learn the
      stomp augment. Once you reach 5th level, you learn the acclimatize
      augment. Constitution is your psionic ability for these
      powers.</p><p><strong>Naturally Psionic</strong>. You gain an internal
      reserve of psionic energy represented by psi points. Your psi point
      maximum is 2, or your existing psi point maximum from another source (such
      as levels in a class with the Psionics feature) increases by 2. When you
      reach 5th level, your psi point maximum increases by an additional
      2.</p><p>All expended psi points are restored when you finish a long rest.
      Your psi limit is 2, and when you reach 5th level your psi limit increases
      to 4, if it is not already higher.</p><p><strong>Powerful Build</strong>.
      You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and
      the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>.

      Goblin</p>
