      <p>Your aasimar character has the following racial
      traits.</p><p><strong>Age</strong>. Aasimar mature at the same rate as
      humans, but they can live up to 160 years.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>.
      Aasimar have the same range of height and weight as
      humans.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. Blessed with a radiant soul, your
      vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60
      feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
      light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Celestial Resistance</strong>. You have resistance to
      necrotic damage and radiant damage.</p><p><strong>Consuming
      Touch</strong>. As an action, you can make a melee spell attack against a
      creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes necrotic damage
      equal to your level and you regain hit points equal to half the damage
      dealt (round up). Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until
      you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this
      trait.</p><p><strong>Herald of Doom</strong>. You know the toll the dead
      cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
      it.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>. You can speak, read, and write
      Common and Celestial.</p><p><strong>Necrotic Shroud.</strong> Starting at
      3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within
      yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and two
      skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant
      you transform, other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see you must
      each succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus +
      your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your
      next turn.</p><p>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end
      it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal
      extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an
      attack or a spell. The extra necrotic damage equals your level.</p><p>Once
      you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
