    value: >-
      <p>When you cast Gray Gaze, you can choose to augment it. If a creature
      fails its saving throw against the augmented spell, it has the
      &amp;Reference[Restrained] condition for 1 minute instead of having
      Disadvantage on its next Dexterity saving throw. A Restrained target makes
      another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
      the effect on a success. You must concentrate to maintain the effect. If
      you lose your Concentration, the creature no longer has the Restrained
      condition. </p><p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your
      Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p>
