      <p><strong>Age</strong>. Dromites reach maturity and are accepted into
      their chosen caste at around 15 years old and live about as long as humans
      do.</p><p><strong>Alignment</strong>. Dromites tend toward no particular
      alignment. Unlike a colony of true insects, a city-hive is made up of
      individuals and does not act under a central hive-mind. Therefore, each
      dromite is free to choose their own outlook in
      life.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size is Small. To set your height
      and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier.</p><p
      style="text-align:center">Size modifier = 2d4</p><p
      style="text-align:center">Height = 2 feet + 7 inches + your size modifier
      in inches</p><p style="text-align:center">Weight in pounds = 30 + your
      size modifier</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed is 25
      feet.</p><p><strong>Energy Caste</strong>. You belong to one of four
      energy castes. Choose a caste from the Dromite Castes table. Your choice
      of caste specifies the type of damage you deal when manifesting a power
      granted by your Dromite Psychokinesis and determines the type of energy
      you resist with your Damage Resistance
      trait.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Caste</th><th>Damage

      Psychokinesis</strong>. You know the energy ray psionic talent. Once you
      reach 3rd level, you learn the synaptic arc augment. Once you reach 5th
      level, you learn the pyrokinetic detonation augment. Charisma is your
      psionic ability for these powers.</p><p>Whenever you manifest or cast a
      psionic power granted by this trait, the damage the power deals is the
      damage type associated with your energy caste, regardless of the damage
      type the power normally deals.</p><p><strong>Naturally Psionic</strong>.
      You gain an internal reserve of psionic energy represented by psi points.
      Your psi point maximum is 2, or your existing psi point maximum from
      another source (such as levels in a class with the Psionics feature)
      increases by 2. When you reach 5th level, your psi point maximum increases
      by an additional 2.</p><p>All expended psi points are restored when you
      finish a long rest. Your psi limit is 2, and when you reach 5th level your
      psi limit increases to 4, if it is not already
      higher.</p><p><strong>Damage Resistance</strong>. Your chitinous skin
      grants you resistance to the damage type associated with your energy
      caste.</p><p><strong>Insectoid Senses</strong>. You have antennae that
      supplement your other senses. You have proficiency in the Perception
      skill. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Wisdom (Perception) check
      you make that relies on smell.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. Thanks
      to your compound, insectoid eyes, you have superior vision in dark and dim
      conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
      bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You canâ€™t discern
      color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>.
      You can speak, read, and write Riedran and one extra language of your
      choice.</p>
