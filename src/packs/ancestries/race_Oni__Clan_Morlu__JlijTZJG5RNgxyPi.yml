    value: >-
      <p>The ogres of Boranun once bound many types of fiends to their
      bloodlines, creating the first oni. Once upon a time, these oni lines were
      once formed into great clans, and you carry a spark of that ancient
      legacy. Borunan oni stand between 6-8 feet tall depending on their
      fiendish origin and weigh between 200-400 pounds. Oni reach adulthood at
      20 and live up to 150 years.</p><p>In a turn of cosmic irony, your
      bloodline jails a chain devil — one of the Legion of Tyranny’s diabolic
      captains and torturers. The fiend’s innate powers allow you to manipulate
      ropes and chains, and grant familiarity with locks and restraints. Clan
      Morlu are hornless with ochrered skin, and often wield weapons such as
      whips and flails in battle.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are
      a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>: Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p>Master of Chains. You can cast the ensnaring strike and snare
      spells with this trait. Once you cast either of these spells with this
      trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long
      rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you
      have.</p><p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability
      for these spells (choose when you gain this species). Neither of these
      spells require spell components when you cast them with this
      trait.</p><p><strong>Powerful Build</strong>. You count as one size larger
      when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag,
      or lift.</p><p><strong>Unbound</strong>. You have advantage on saving
      throws made to avoid or end the paralyzed condition on yourself.</p>
