      <p><strong>Age</strong>. A typical warforged is between two and thirty
      years old. The maximum warforged lifespan remains a mystery; so far,
      warforged have shown no signs of deterioration due to age. You are immune
      to magical aging effects.</p><p><strong>Alignment</strong>. Most warforged
      take comfort in order and discipline, tending toward law and neutrality.
      But some have absorbed the morality, or lack thereof, of the beings with
      which they served.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size is Medium. To
      set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size
      modifier.</p><p style="text-align:center">Size modifier = 2d6</p><p
      style="text-align:center">Height = 5 feet + 10 inches + your size modifier
      in inches</p><p style="text-align:center">Weight in pounds = 270 + (4 x
      your size modifier)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed
      is 30 feet. </p><p><strong>Constructed Resilience.</strong> You were
      created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>You have advantage on saving throws against being
      poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li><li>You don’t need
      to eat, drink, or breathe.</li><li>You are immune to disease.</li><li>You
      don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to
      sleep.</li></ul><p><strong>Crystalline Growths</strong>. Your constructed
      body is covered in numerous crystals. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class,
      but you cannot don armor.</p><p><strong>Psiactive Crystal</strong>. You
      know the imbue psicrystal psionic talent. Once you reach 3rd level, you
      learn the fortify psicrystal augment. Once you reach 5th level, you learn
      the crystal flechette augment. Intelligence is your psionic ability for
      these powers.</p><p>When you cast imbue psicrystal, you may spend 1 psi
      point to use your own body’s crystals as the material component. If you
      do, a fist-sized chunk of crystal harmlessly separates from your body and
      becomes the psicrystal. When your focus on imbued psicrystal ends, you may
      reintegrate the separated crystal back into your
      body.</p><p><strong>Naturally Psionic</strong>. You gain an internal
      reserve of psionic energy represented by psi points. Your psi point
      maximum is 2, or your existing psi point maximum from another source (such
      as levels in a class with the Psionics feature) increases by 2. When you
      reach 5th level, your psi point maximum increases by an additional
      2.</p><p>All expended psi points are restored when you finish a long rest.
      Your psi limit is 2, and when you reach 5th level your psi limit increases
      to 4, if it is not already higher.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>. You
      can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your
      choice</p>
