  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Harpies blend avian and human elements, possessing functional wings and
      birdlike legs ending in clawed feet. But the most remarkable feature of a
      harpy is their voice. Arcane power flows through a harpy and into their
      words, allowing them to manipulate emotions and to charm even the most
      hardened of hearts. While there are always exceptions, most harpies are
      passionate and energetic; the power of their song reflects their own
      surging emotions. Most enjoy the freedom of flight, expressing themselves
      through sound and motion. </p><p>The passionate nature of the harpy is
      reflected in their devotion to family, friends, and causes. Some of the
      harpy flights of Droaam are the most loyal allies of the Daughters of Sora
      Kell, while others stubbornly oppose their plans for Droaam. When creating
      a harpy character, think about their driving passion and pursue it
      fiercely</p>
