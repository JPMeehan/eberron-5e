      celestial gifts of the aasimar with the long lifespan and fey blood of the
      elves.</p><h3>Court Aasimar Traits</h3><p>Your aasimar character has the

      same rate as an elf, but you can live up to 1,000
      years.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Aasimar have the same range of height
      and weight as humans.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking
      speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. Blessed with a
      radiant soul, your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in
      dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
      darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness,
      only shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Celestial Resistance</strong>. You have
      resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.</p><p><strong>Healing
      Hands</strong>. As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to
      regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this
      trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long
      rest.</p><p><strong>Light Bearer</strong>. You know the light cantrip.
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
      it.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>. You can speak, read, and write
      Common and Celestial.</p><p><strong>Fey Ancestry</strong>. You have
      advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you
      to sleep.</p><p><strong>Trance</strong>. You don’t need to sleep. Instead,
      you meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After
      resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8
      hours of sleep.</p><p><strong>Extra Language</strong>. You can speak,
      read, and write Elvish. </p><p><strong>Guidance From the Past.</strong>
      Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to draw on your connection to
      your ancestors. Misty tendrils flow around you, whispering advice only you
      can hear. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a
      bonus action. During it, you gain advantage on all Wisdom checks and
      saving throws.</p><p>Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until
      you finish a long rest.</p>
