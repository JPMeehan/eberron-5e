      only shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Celestial Resistance</strong>. You have
      resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.</p><p><strong>Healing
      Hands</strong>. As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to

      During it, you gain advantage on all Wisdom checks and saving
      throws.</p><p>Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you
      finish a long rest.</p>
