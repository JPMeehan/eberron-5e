    value: >-
      <p><strong>Age</strong>. Thri-kreen are extremely short-lived, reaching
      adulthood after only 6 or 7 years, and rarely see 30 years of age.
      Alignment. Modern thri-kreen have nearly no conception of formalized
      society among their own kind and tend toward chaotic
      alignments.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size is Medium. To set your
      height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier.</p><p
      style="text-align:center">Size modifier = 2d12</p><p
      style="text-align:center">Height = 4 feet + 10 inches + your size modifier
      in inches</p><p style="text-align:center">Weight in pounds = 125 + (2d6 x
      your size modifier)</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed
      is 35 feet.</p><p><strong>Extra Arms</strong>. You have two pairs of arms,
      a major pair and a minor pair. Your major arms can perform all the
      functions a normal humanoid’s arms and hands can, but your minor arms are
      smaller and weaker. You cannot effectively wield weapons or use a shield
      with your minor arms, nor can you fulfill somatic components for spells
      with them, but you may otherwise perform any other action with them, such
      as writing, opening doors, retrieving or stowing an item, or even drawing
      a weapon and passing it to a major arm’s hand.</p><p>Additionally, having
      a second pair of arms allows you to interact with a second object during
      your turn without using your action. If you want to interact with a third
      object, you need to use your action. (Some magic items and other special
      objects always require an action to use, as stated in their
      descriptions.)</p><p><strong>Thri-Kreen Weapon Training.</strong> You have
      proficiency with the gythka and chatkcha. These weapons have the same
      statistics as the orc double axe and Adaran boomerang detailed in
      Korranberg Chronicle: Adventurer’s Almanac, respectively.</p><p>If your
      game does not make use of that book, use the statistics for the greataxe
      and handaxe instead, except the handaxe has the finesse
      property.</p><p><strong>Natural Armor</strong>. You have a hard, chitinous
      exoskeleton. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity
      modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor
      you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as
      normal while you use your natural armor.</p><p><strong>Thri-Kreen
      Psionics</strong>. You know the primal metabolism psionic talent. Once you
      reach 3rd level, you learn the psionic leap augment. Once you reach 5th
      level, you learn the bestial claws augment. Wisdom is your psionic ability
      for these powers.</p><p>Whenever you manifest psionic leap using this
      feature, the power augments primal metabolism instead of the normal talent
      mentioned in the power’s description.</p><p><strong>Naturally
      Psionic</strong>. You gain an internal reserve of psionic energy
      represented by psi points. Your psi point maximum is 2, or your existing
      psi point maximum from another source (such as levels in a class with the
      Psionics feature) increases by 2. When you reach 5th level, your psi point
      maximum increases by an additional 2.</p><p>All expended psi points are
      restored when you finish a long rest. Your psi limit is 2, and when you
      reach 5th level your psi limit increases to 4, if it is not already
      higher.</p><p><strong>Reverie</strong>. You cannot be magically put to
      sleep, and you are immune to magical spells and effects that require you
      to dream, like the dream spell.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>. You can
      communicate in a language unique to Thri-kreen and can understand one
      other language of your choice. Thri-kreen do not speak, but can
      communicate in their own language through their antennae movements,
      mandible clacking, and pheromones. When expressing yourself in other
      languages, you are limited to writing only</p>
