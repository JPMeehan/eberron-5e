  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are a dromite, a member of a vast underground society of hive
      cities and psionic prowess. You have spent nearly your entire life
      underground, venturing to the surface to barter for goods or explore lands
      beyond rock and stone. For some, this is a great honor, as you may have
      served as a guide or mail carrier. For others, this has led only to
      tragedy at the hands of the Unity of Riedra.</p><p><strong>Creature
      Type</strong>. You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size
      is Small.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. Thanks to your compound,
      insectoid eyes, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
      can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
      in darkness as if it were dim light. You canâ€™t discern color in darkness,
      only shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Essence Form</strong>. You developed an
      affinity for a particular essence when you grew to full maturity. Choose
      an essence from the Essence Forms table. Your choice of essence cannot be
      changed, and determines the damage type for your other traits, as shown on
      the table.</p><table><caption><strong>Essence
      Form</strong></caption><thead><tr><th>Essence</th><th>Damage
      Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Glimmer</td><td>Lightning</td></tr><tr><td>Ice</td><td>Cold</td></tr><tr><td>Torch</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>Voice</td><td>Thunder</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Psychokinetic
      Ray</strong>. You can channel psionic power to fire psychokinetic rays. As
      an action, you fire a number of rays equal to half your Proficiency Bonus
      (rounded up). For each ray, you make a spell attack against an object or
      creature within 90 feet of you. On a hit you deal damage of the type
      associated with your Essence Form equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability
      modifier. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability
      for these rays (choose when you select this species).</p><p>You can use
      this action a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you
      regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>Damage
      Resistance</strong>. You have Resistance to the damage type determined by
      your Essence Form.</p><p><strong>Insectoid Senses</strong>. You have
      antennae that supplement your other senses. You have proficiency in the
      Perception skill</p>
