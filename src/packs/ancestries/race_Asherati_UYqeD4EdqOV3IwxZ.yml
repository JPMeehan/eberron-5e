  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are an asherati, a child of the First Families of the Menechtarun
      marked by your skin made from fluid sand. You have spent your life in the
      blazing sands of the western deserts, hidden and protected within a
      subterranean village. Your family works together as a unit to survive,
      using the ability to swim through sand like water to travel, trade, and
      hunt. Asherati use their innate ability to produce light as a form of
      fashion; many display beautiful patterns of light across their skin, often
      mirroring the constellations. Whether as a druid, sandshaper, or zealot of
      the Star Pilgrims, you have found reason to part from your family - and
      the foreign green and blue oceans beyond now beckon you to unknown
      goals.</p><p>When creating an asherati character, consider:</p><ol><li>Why
      are you leaving your desert home?</li><li>Do you find the moist greenery
      of northern Xenâ€™drik to be exciting, or unnerving?</li><li>How do you
      react to the prospect of the ocean, or sailing on
      it?</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>. Asherati stand between 5-6 feet
      tall. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking
      speed is 30 feet, and you have a burrowing speed equal to your walking
      speed in loose sand, dust, and ash, but not soil. You leave no tunnel
      behind when you burrow in this way, and can breathe as normal while doing
      so.</p><p><strong>Desert Adaptation</strong>. You have resistance to fire
      damage.</p><p><strong>Harsh Survivor</strong>. You gain proficiency in the
      Survival and Stealth skills.</p><p><strong>Inner Light</strong>. As a
      bonus action, you can cause your body to magically glow, providing bright
      light in a 20 foot radius around you and dim light for an additional 20
      feet. If you are burrowing underground, this light allows your adapted
      eyes to navigate and identify objects in a 60 foot radius as if you were
      in normal dim light.</p><p>You can use an action to bring your inner light
      to full brilliance. Every creature within 15 feet of you must succeed on a
      Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of their next
      turn. When you select this ancestry, you can choose Intelligence, Wisdom,
      or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for this feature. You regain the
      ability to use this feature upon completing a long rest.</p><p>Asherati
      typically place their family name first, and personal name second. For
      example, siblings might be called Em-Sarhi and Em-Zeresh</p><p>Names:
      Inuras, Sehev, Asharha, Larash, Umvir, Dasra</p><p>Family: Em, Na, Vei,
      Idu, Sa, Dve, Ehz</p>
