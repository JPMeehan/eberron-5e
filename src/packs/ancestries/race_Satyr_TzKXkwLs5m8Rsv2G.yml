      <p>Much like your eladrin brethren, you are almost certainly from the
      great feyspire of Shae Tan Feilar. You come from stories of revelry and
      daring feats, and you wish for a great challenge to come into your life,
      whether it be in Thelanis or the mountains of Adar. With a smile on your
      lips and hooves almost tailor-made for the mountainsides, your next
      adventure is certainly going to be one to tell stories
      about.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Fey.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>: Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Your base walking speed is 35
      feet.</p><p><strong>Ram</strong>. You can use your head and horns to make
      unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your
      Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage
      normal for an unarmed strike.</p><p><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>. You
      have advantage on saving throws against spells.</p><p><strong>Mirthful
      Leaps</strong>. Whenever you make a long jump or a high jump, you can roll
      a d8 and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when
      making a standing jump. This extra distance costs movement as
      usual.</p><p><strong>Reveler</strong>. As an embodiment of revelry, you
      have proficiency in the Performance and Persuasion skills, and you have
      proficiency with one musical instrument of your choice.</p>
