      <p>Dhakaani goblins are known as golin’dar, “quick folk.” They reproduce
      and mature faster than other dar, and form the bulk of the labor force in
      Dhakaani society. This includes menial labor, agriculture, food
      preparation, and skilled craftwork. Though ghaal’dar are the primary
      smiths of weapons and armor, most other manufacturing is done by the
      golin’dar. While this work may be less dramatic than the martial paths of
      the ghaal’dar and guul’dar, it’s vital to survival and the golin’dar are
      respected for their contributions. Other golin’dar take a different path,
      that of the Khesh’dar, the Silent Folk who live in the shadows of the
      empire. Your golin’dar character has the following
      traits.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Golin’dar reach adulthood at
      age 8 and live up to 60 years.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em>
      Golin’dar are between 3 and 4 feet tall and weigh between 40 and 80
      pounds. Your size is Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your
      base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em>
      You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light,
      and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in
      darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Naturally
      Stealthy.</strong></em> You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured
      only by a creature that is at least one size larger than
      you.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and
      write Common and Goblin.</p><p><em><strong>Basic Training.</strong></em>
