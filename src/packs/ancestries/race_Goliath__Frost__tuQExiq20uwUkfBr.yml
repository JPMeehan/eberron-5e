  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are a true descendant of the giants of old, who gave up their size
      and power in exchange for equity and peace. Whether a fire goliath
      descendant of the Sul’at League, or a cloud goliath of the nomadic
      Gallimaufry, you retain a spark of planar power in your soul - and can
      wield it to ward off your foes. Whether you see pride in the legacy of the
      giants, or curse them for their ruinous wake, your ties to them are
      undeniable. Some goliaths dwell in cities such as Kul Lerek, while others
      prefer a nomadic life - or one in search of the power their ancestors were
      fools to leave behind.</p><p>Goliaths stand between 7-8 feet tall, with
      sturdy builds. They have lifespans comparable to humans.</p><p>When
      creating a goliath character, consider:</p><ol><li>What link do you have
      to the giants of old?</li><li>Are you keen to recover their secrets, or do
      you see no connection to the tyrants of history?</li><li>Do you feel in
      control of the spark of magic within you, or do you fear the power it
      brings?</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>. Goliaths are between 7 and 8
      feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base
      walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Powerful Build</strong>. You count
      as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight
      you can push, drag, or lift.</p><p><strong>Giant Spark</strong>. Starting
      at 3rd level, you gain the ability to grow by stoking the spark of magic
      within you. As a bonus action, you can change your size to Large, provided
      you’re in a big enough space, causing your dimensions to double and your
      weight to be multiplied by eight. Your equipment similarly increases in
      size. While Large, you have advantage on Strength ability checks and
      Saving throws, your speed increases by 5 feet, and your first attack that
      hits on your turn deals an additional 1d4 damage. This transformation
      lasts for 10 minutes, or until you end it as a bonus action. Once you use
      this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long
      rest.</p><p><strong>Titan Heritage</strong>. You inherit abilities innate
      to your giant lineage. Choose one of the following lineages; you
      permanently gain its abilities:</p><h3 id="frost">Frost</h3><p><strong>Ice
      Born</strong>. You have resistance to cold damage.</p><p><strong>Rime
      Armor</strong>. As a bonus action, you gain temporary hit points equal to
      your level. You can use this action a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses upon completing a long
      rest.</p><hr /><p>Goliath names are based on the Giant language, and often
      feature titles and deeds instead of family names, as a cultural callback
      to the nations of old. Goliath leaders (in societies that don’t see their
      history as a disgrace) often include a glottal stop ( ‘ ) in their name as
      a sign of status.</p><p><strong>Names:</strong> Thenghor, Omnakara,
      Sohlus, Jusenka, Andrahsa, Ouron, Ahlmar, Harghost,
      Kandarn</p><p><strong>Second Names:</strong> Stormcaller, Of The Anvil,
      Scalebane, Cloudbreak, Flame-Heart, Twice-Cursed, Worldwake</p>
