    value: >-
      <p>Your world died to the powers of Xoriat, and that fact angers you on a
      level others cannot comprehend. Now in a different material world, you
      have chosen to fight against inevitability. Whether you have decided to
      raid Eberron and the planes with city-ships, or take up arms to defend
      Adar, the land that has given you a home, the desire to fight runs deep
      within your training.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. You are
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Astral Knowledge</strong>. You can mystically access a
      reservoir of experiences of entities connected to the Astral Plane.
      Whenever you finish a long rest, you gain proficiency in one skill of your
      choice and with one weapon or tool of your choice, selected from the
      Player's Handbook, as you momentarily project your consciousness into the
      Astral Plane. These proficiencies last until the end of your next long
      rest.</p><p><strong>Githyanki Psionics</strong>. You know the mage hand
      cantrip, and the hand is invisible when you cast the cantrip with this
      trait.</p><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the jump spell with this
      trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast misty step with it. Once
      you cast jump or misty step with this trait, you can't cast that spell
      with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of
      those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these
      spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this
      race). None of these spells require spell components when you cast them
      with this trait.</p><p><strong>Psychic Resilience</strong>. You have
      resistance to psychic damage</p>
