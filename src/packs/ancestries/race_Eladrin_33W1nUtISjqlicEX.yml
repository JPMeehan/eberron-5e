      <p>Most likely, if you are an eladrin in Adar, you are from Shae Tan
      Feilar, the City of Cliff and Gale. You have spent countless years
      searching for the greatest feats, performing daring stunts, great dances,
      and stunning displays of athleticism. You are away from home for likely
      the same reason youâ€™re always away from home; searching for the next great
      story to take home to your friends and family.</p><p>Choose your eladrin's
      season: autumn, winter, spring, or summer. When finishing a long rest, you
      can change your season.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Fey. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that
      requires you to be an elf.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. You are
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Fey Ancestry</strong>. You have advantage on saving
      throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself. Fey
      Step. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an
      unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times
      equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.</p><p>When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gains an
      additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving
      throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (choose when you select this
      species):</p><ul><li><strong>Autumn</strong>. Immediately after you use
      your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within
      10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you
      for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to the
      creatures.</li><li><strong>Winter</strong>. When you use your Fey Step,
      one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before
      you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you
      until the end of your next turn.</li><li><strong>Spring</strong>. When you
      use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of
      you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an
      unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of
      you.</li><li><strong>Summer</strong>. Immediately after you use your Fey
      Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you
      takes fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Keen Senses. You have
      proficiency in the Perception skill.</li></ul><p><strong>Trance</strong>.
      You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish
      a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike
      meditation, during which you retain consciousness.</p><p>Whenever you
      finish this trance, you can change your season, and you can gain two
      proficiencies that you don't have, each one with a weapon or a tool of
      your choice selected from the Player's Handbook. You mystically acquire
      these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you
      retain them until you finish your next long rest</p>
