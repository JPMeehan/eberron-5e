    value: >-
      <p>Long ago, the ogres of Sarlona lived in Borunan, fighting an eternal
      war alongside the angels of Shavarath. The Inspired thoroughly crushed
      this ancient tradition, forcing the once-proud ogres into a life of manual
      labor, servitude, and dehumanization. Others fled into Syrkarn or Adar,
      carrying the shame of abandoning their ancient allies. The future of your
      people is uncertain. Do you try and reclaim your birthright? Do you use
      the powers of old for your own designs?</p><p><strong>Creature
      Type</strong>. You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size
      is Medium, but you cannot squeeze through spaces that would fit a Small
      creature. Speed. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Natural Athlete</strong>. You are proficient in the
      Athletics skill, and do not suffer a penalty to your movement while
      grappling a Medium or smaller
      creature.</p><p><strong>Long-Limbed.</strong> When you make a melee attack
      on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than
      normal.</p><p><strong>Powerful Build</strong>. You count as one size
      larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can
      push, drag, or lift.</p><p><strong>Yield No Ground.</strong> You have
      advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid being grappled
      or moved against your will by other creatures, and you cannot be dragged
      or carried by a creature grappling you unless they are Huge or larger.</p>
