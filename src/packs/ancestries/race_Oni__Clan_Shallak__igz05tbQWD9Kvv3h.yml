      <p>The ogres of Boranun once bound many types of fiends to their
      bloodlines, creating the first oni. Once upon a time, these oni lines were
      once formed into great clans, and you carry a spark of that ancient
      legacy. Borunan oni stand between 6-8 feet tall depending on their
      fiendish origin and weigh between 200-400 pounds. Oni reach adulthood at
      20 and live up to 150 years.</p><p>Clan Shallak bear the burden of an
      imprisoned arcanaloth mercenary — one of the Legion of Tyranny’s dangerous
      war mages. The fiend grants you an innate sense for the workings of magic,
      and an understanding of the workings of spells. Many oni of Clan Shallak
      once trained as battlesages and spellsmiths within the Cauldron. Such oni
      often have sharp fangs and bestial eyes as a mark of their
      heritage.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
