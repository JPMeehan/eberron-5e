      <p>Tieflings are rarely seen in the Five Nations, and are often treated
      with fear and suspicion when they are. Rather than being directly
      descended from fiends, the most common tieflings of Eberron are touched by
      the malefic energies of one of the planes. Because of this, their
      appearance varies dramatically. Mabaran tieflings are reminiscent of
      incubi and succubi, with sinister beauty and small horns and fangs.
      Shavaran tieflings have scaly skin and horns of steel, while Risian
      tieflings are coated in frost and have horns of ice. Others don’t have
      horns at all. Dolurrhi tieflings usually have gray skin and pale eyes,
      with tendrils of whispering mist clinging to their skin. Kythrian
      tieflings slowly change in appearance, with every aspect changing in time.
      Such plane-touched tieflings don’t pass these traits on to their children;
      the birth of a tiefling is tied to the flow of planar energies, most often
      occurring when a child is conceived in a manifest zone at a key point in a
      plane’s coterminous cycle.</p><p>Tieflings are only created by the malefic
      influence of a plane, and there are no tieflings tied to Daanvi, Irian,
      Lamannia, or Syrania, or Thelanis. Popular stories say that tieflings are
      cursed and that they draw the negative powers of the plane wherever they
      go; while this is largely just superstition, it can make life difficult
      for tieflings.</p><p>Planar tieflings don’t pass their traits to their
      offspring, which is why tieflings are rare in the Five Nations. But there
      are two other types of tiefling in Khorvaire. The Sakah are said to be
      descended from rakshasa, fiends who infused their immortal essence into
      mortal bloodlines. In their natural form, they have feline features with
      fiendish aspects—burning eyes, backward hands, disturbing fangs—that set
      them apart from shifters. Most of the Sakah are in the Demon Wastes, but
      some capable Sakah serve as agents of the Lords of Dust in the wider
      world. The final source of tieflings are the noble bloodlines of the
      Venomous Demesne. The Demesne tieflings are the result of fiendish
      bargains made long ago by the mages of Ohr Kaluun. Demesne tieflings
      should use the Infernal, Chthonic, or Abyssal legacies as presented in the
      Player’s Handbook. Planar and Sakah tieflings should use one of the
      Fiendish Legacies presented in the Eberron Fiendish Legacies table. All
      other traits for Planar and Sakah tieflings are the same as those in the
      Player’s Handbook.</p><h3>Tiefling Traits</h3><p><em><strong>Fiendish
