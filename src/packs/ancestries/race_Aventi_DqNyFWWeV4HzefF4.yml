      <p>As an aventi, you belong to one of Sarlona’s only waterbound people.
      Though most prefer staying close to the Aventus Islands and the ruins of
      your people’s calamity, you have chosen to wander far from home. Perhaps
      you wish to explore the surface world your ancestors once called home.
      Perhaps you wish to strike against the Riedrans who now control your
      islands. Whatever the case, you are far from home — and getting back will
      be a feat indeed.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30 feet, and
      you have a swimming speed equal to your walking
      speed.</p><p><strong>Amphibious</strong>. You can breathe air and
      water.</p><p><strong>Control Air and Water.</strong> You can cast fog
      cloud with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the gust of
      wind spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the
      water walk spell with it. Once you cast any of these spells with this
      trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long
      rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have of the
      appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting
      ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when
      you select this species).</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see
      in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in
      darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only
      as shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Emissary of the Sea.</strong> You can
      communicate simple ideas to any Beast, Elemental, or Monstrosity that has
      a swimming speed. It can understand your words, though you have no special
      ability to understand it in return.</p><p><strong>Guardian of the
      Depths.</strong> Adapted to the frigid ocean depths, you have resistance
      to cold damage</p>
