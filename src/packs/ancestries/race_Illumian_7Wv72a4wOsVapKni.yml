  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Long ago, in another world and another time and another version of
      Eberron, there was a world called Sardior. The primary celestials of this
      other Eberron were known as sybillic guardians, beings made of holy words
      and language. When the daelkyr began corrupting the world, the celestials
      sought to save as many of the native gith as possible. In a great working,
      the sybillic guardians merged with willing hosts, each who carried a
      fraction of the celestial’s great power, becoming illumians.</p><p>As an
      illumian and Sardiorian, you look largely like a gith or gem dragonborn
      with a ring of glowing words around your head. You fulfil the same role in
      Sardiorian society as an aasimar would, a being of great divinity and
      promise. You have been chosen to continue carrying on your people’s faith
      and beliefs; how you do that in a world not your own is ultimately up to
      you.</p><p>When an illumian dies, their body releases the stored Illumian
      language within it. For 1 round per Hit Die of the illumian, anyone within
      earshot hears ululating Illumian syllables — usually gibberish, but
      occasionally a prophetic phrase or a final curse on the illumian’s
      enemies. The illumian’s body need not remain intact for the final
      utterance to occur. Even if an illumian succumbs to a disintegrate spell,
      their disembodied voice still utters strange gibberish for several
      rounds.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Glyphic Resistance</strong>. As an embodiment of the
      magical Illumian language, you are immune to any spell or magical effect
      that has the following words in its name: “glyph”, “rune”, “runic”,
      “symbol”, or “word”. While you are conscious, you can choose to be
      affected by such spells or effects.</p><p><strong>Language
      Incarnate</strong>. You know the Illumian language in addition to your
      other languages.</p><p><strong>Luminous Sigils</strong>. The insubstantial
      symbols that orbit your head shed dim light around you out to a radius of
      5 feet. As a bonus action, you can make these symbols disappear or
      reappear, but your Power Sigils trait grants you no benefits while they
      are not present.</p><p><strong>Power Sigils</strong>. One of the symbols
      floating around your head is a Power Sigil, which grants you a trait
      appropriate to the sigil’s Common meaning (provided in parentheses). When
      you reach 3rd level, you gain a second Power Sigil, which must be
      different from the first. You choose both of these Power Sigils from the
      below list:</p><p><strong>Aesh (“vigor”).</strong> You have proficiency in
      the Athletics skill and you count as one size larger when determining your
      carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or
      lift.</p><p><strong>Hoon (“life”).</strong> Your hit point maximum
      increases by an amount equal to your level when you gain this Power Sigil,
      and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level
      thereafter.</p><p><strong>Krau (“magic”).</strong> You have proficiency in
      the Arcana skill and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws to
      maintain your concentration on a spell when you take
      damage.</p><p><strong>Naen (“mind”).</strong> You have resistance to
      psychic damage.</p><p><strong>Uur (“grace”).</strong> You have proficiency
      in the Acrobatics skill and your walking speed increases to 40
      feet.</p><p><strong>Vaul (“soul”).</strong> You have advantage on all
      Charisma saving throws</p>
