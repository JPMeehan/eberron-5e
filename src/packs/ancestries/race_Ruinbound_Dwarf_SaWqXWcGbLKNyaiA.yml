      <p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Dwarves mature at the same rate as
      humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On
      average, they live about 350 years.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em>
      Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your
      size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking
      speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy
      armor.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Accustomed to life
      underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
      see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
      darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness,
      only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Dwarven Resilience.</strong></em>
      You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have
      resistance against poison damage.</p><p><em><strong>Dwarven Combat
      Training.</strong></em> You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe,
      light hammer, and warhammer.</p><p><em><strong>Tool
      Proficiency.</strong></em> You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools
      of your choice: smith's tools, brewer's supplies, or mason's
      tools.</p><p><em><strong>Stonecunning.</strong></em> Whenever you make an
      Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are
      considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency
      bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency
      bonus.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and
      write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and
      guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other
      language a dwarf might speak.</p><h5>Ruinbound Dwarf</h5><p>The Doldarun
      dwarves say that any contact with the Realms Below corrupts the Mror.
      There’s one recent development that supports their argument—the occasional
      birth of ruinbound dwarves among the Mror clans. The ruinbound dwarf is
      born with a personal symbiont—an unnatural entity bound to the child.
      Unlike most symbionts, this entity cannot be separated from its host, and
      the two are permanently fused. Many ruinbound dwarves have additional
      disturbing mutations; you can roll on the Ruinbound Mutations table for
      ideas, or create your own. These secondary mutations are disturbing, but
      they don’t change the rules of how that character is played or grant
      mechanical benefits. For example, even if a ruinbound dwarf seems to have
      no eyes, their vision uncannily works as well as any other dwarf, though
      it defies logic.</p><p>If you are a ruinbound dwarf, you have this
      subrace, with the following traits.</p><p><em><strong>Personal
      Symbiont.</strong></em> You are bound to an alien entity. It’s part of
      your body and can’t be removed. Your symbiont possesses a minor
      supernatural ability, which it can use on your behalf.</p><p>Choose a
      cantrip from the following list: acid splash, guidance (self only),
      infestation XGE, light, mage hand, poison spray, ray of frost. As long as
      your personal symbiont is fully exposed, you can cast that cantrip. You
      can choose to conceal the symbiont, but you can only cast the cantrip you
      gain with this trait while it’s exposed.</p><p>When you finish a long
      rest, you can mutate the symbiont, gaining different benefits; when you do
      so, you can select a different cantrip from this list. Charisma is your
      spellcasting ability for this cantrip.</p><p>Work with your DM to
      determine the appearance of your symbiont. It is organic and clearly
      alien, and when you cast a cantrip with this trait, it should be obvious
      that the symbiont is the source. A symbiont that casts mage hand could be
      a thin tentacle or an ectoplasmic insect that emerges from your body and
      performs the action. An eyestalk protruding from your shoulder could grant
      you guidance as it studies the situation and telepathically advises you—or
      it might blast your enemies with a ray of frost. Infestation could reflect
      a cloud of insects always hovering around you.</p><p><em><strong>Symbiont
      Mastery.</strong></em> You can attune to one magic item that has the
      Symbiotic Nature property without using an attunement slot. In addition,
      after you finish a long rest, you can end your attunement to a magic item
      that has the Symbiotic Nature property</p>
