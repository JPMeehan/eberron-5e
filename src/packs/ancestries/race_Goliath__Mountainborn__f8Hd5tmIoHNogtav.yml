    value: >-
      <p>The goliath families of Sarlona are some of the oldest settlers of the
      continent. Though even your greatest elders cannot remember when and why
      their ancestors made the journey from Xen’drik to Sarlona, you have called
      this land home for millennia. You are most likely a member of the goliath
      clans in the mountains of Adar, known as the pathadrik or “wandering
      giants” in Adaran.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Little Giant</strong>. You have proficiency in the
      Athletics skill, and you count as one size larger when determining your
      carrying weight and the weight you can push, drag, or
      lift.</p><p><strong>Mountain Born</strong>. You have resistance to cold
      damage. You also naturally acclimate to high altitudes, even if you've
      never been to one. This includes elevations above 20,000
      feet.</p><p>Stone's Endurance. You can supernaturally draw on unyielding
      stone to shrug off harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction
      to roll a d12. Add your79 Constitution modifier to the number rolled and
      reduce the damage by that total.</p><p>You can use this trait a number of
      times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses
      when you finish a long rest</p>
