      "value": "<p class=\"5E-COREBODYPARA1\">Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn.</p><p class=\"5E-COREBODYPARA2\"><em><strong>Suggested Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Charisma score increases by 1. (The other +2 comes from your subrace)</p><p class=\"5E-COREBODYPARA2\"><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</p><p class=\"5E-COREBODYPARA2\"><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p class=\"5E-COREBODYPARA2\"><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p class=\"5E-COREBODYPARA2\"><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.</p><h5>Breath Weapon</h5><table><tbody><tr><th><p>Damage Type</p></th><th><p>Saving Throw</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Acid</p></td><td><p>Dexterity</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cold</p></td><td><p>Constitution</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fire</p></td><td><p>Dexterity</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lightning</p></td><td><p>Dexterity</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Poison</p></td><td><p>Constitution</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong></em> You can use your bonus action to exhale destructive energy. Choose a damage type from the Breath Weapon table. In addition, choose whether your breath weapon manifests in a 15 ft. cone or a 5 by 30 ft. line. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your choice on the Breath Weapon table. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 9th level, 5d6 at 13th level, and 6d6 at 17th level.</p><p>After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Aquatic.</strong></em> You have a swim speed of 30 feet and you can breathe both air and water. </p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Bred for maneuvering in the twilight and darkness of the ocean, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p><p><em><strong>Natural Armor.</strong></em> You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor</p>",
