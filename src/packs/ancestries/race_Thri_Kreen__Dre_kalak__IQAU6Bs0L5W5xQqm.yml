    value: >-
      <p>You are a thri-kreen, touched by the Plane of Dreams. It is said that
      thri-kreen see into the plane at all times, shaping their ephemeral
      viewpoints of life and death. Over their history, the thri-kreen have
      built empires and created wonders of great power, but few remain; the
      disaster that befell the hive-city built where modern Stormreach now
      stands is a deep taboo. The thri-kreen of the Skyfall Peninsula are lithe
      and camouflaged, well-suited for their jungle home. In comparison, the
      Ikat-takt ('Titanshells')of the Scimitar Spires are bulky and
      thick-shelled, resembling beetles more than mantids. The Kapaerian Islands
      are instead home to the oracular Dre’kalak ('Death's Head'), who believe
      themselves to lie in the intersection between life’s dream and the
      nightmare of death.</p><p>Thri-kreen stand between 5-6 foot tall, except
      for the Dre’kalak, who are instead between 3-4 foot. Regardless of
      subrace, thri-kreen mature by age 6, and rarely live beyond 30.</p><p>When
      creating a thri-kreen character, consider:</p><ol><li>How do you see the
      ‘sleep’ and dreams of other mortals?</li><li>With your short lifespan,
      what is your view on death?</li><li>What do you hope to achieve by
      becoming an adventurer?</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>. You are
      Small.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your base walking speed is 25
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Secondary Arms</strong>. You have two slightly smaller
      secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms
      function like your primary arms, but cannot wield a shield or
      weapon.</p><p><strong>Sleepless Revitalization</strong>. You do not
      require sleep and can choose to remain conscious during a long rest,
      though you must still refrain from strenuous activity to gain the benefit
      of the rest.</p><p><strong>Thri-kreen Telepathy</strong>. You have the
      magical ability to communicate mentally with any number of willing
      creatures you can see within 120 feet of you. A contacted creature doesn’t
      need to share a language with you, but it must be able to understand at
      least one language. Your telepathic link to a creature is broken if you
      and the creature move more than 120 feet apart, if either of you is
      incapacitated, or if either of you mentally breaks the contact (no action
      required).</p><p><strong>Wings</strong>. Thanks to your wings, you have a
      flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed
      if you're wearing medium or heavy armor</p><p>Thri-kreen names are
      naturally derived from their language, and contain consonants meant to be
      pronounced with insectoid mouthparts.</p><p><strong>Names</strong>:
      Tak’ikt, Ik-chal, Nakt, Kultil, Than-ik’ti, Chathak, Ptikal, Chachat’ka,
      Drulnat</p>
