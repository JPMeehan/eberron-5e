  description:
    value: >-
      <p>It is unknown exactly when the goliaths of Sarlona began practicing
      psionics. Some claim that their distant ancestors in Xen’drik once
      practiced psionics to their great devastation. Others believe the scars of
      their ancestors’ wars with ‘dreams and nightmares’ scarred their people’s
      souls to the point where their distant descendants still bear the burden
      of that calamity. Regardless of the origins, you were born with a bit more
      psionic potential than your peers, something you use to great advantage in
      the mountains of Adar.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Goliath Psionics</strong>. You know the thaumaturgy
      cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the thunderwave spell with
      this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the enhance ability
      spell with it. Once you cast thunderwave or enhance ability with this
      trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long
      rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you
      have of the appropriate level.</p><p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is
      your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this
      trait (choose when you select this species). None of these spells require
      spell components when you cast them with this
      trait.</p><p><strong>Mountain Born</strong>. You have resistance to cold
      damage. You also naturally acclimate to high altitudes, even if you’ve
      never been to one. This includes elevations above 20,000
      feet.</p><p><strong>Stone Grip</strong>. You count as one size larger when
      grappling and determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can
      push, drag, or lift</p>
