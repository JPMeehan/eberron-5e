    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine
      energy within yourself, causing a searing light to radiate from you, pour
      out of your eyes and mouth, and threaten to char you. Your transformation
      lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you
      shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10
      feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within
      10 feet of you take fire damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In
      addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra fire damage to
      one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra
      fire damage equals your level. </p><p>Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t
      use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
