    value: >-
      <p>You are one of the last of a dying tradition. The Doriak dwarves and
      duergar used to be some of the greatest psions and merchants on Sarlona.
      Now, your ancestral home has been destroyed and your people scattered to
      the winds. Some fight on in the Frostwall Mountains. Many more have been
      indoctrinated into the Unity of Riedra. A vanishingly small population
      took refuge in Adar during the Sundering of Sarlona, preserving bits and
      pieces of your culture.</p><p>As a duergar, you were born with an innate
      psionic connection to Dolurrh, echoing your peopleâ€™s history near the
      great Dolurrh wild zones of old.</p><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You
      are a Humanoid. You are also considered a dwarf for any prerequisite or
      effect that requires you to be a dwarf.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your
      size is Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet. Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it
      were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern
      colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p><p><strong>Duergar
      Psionics</strong>. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the enlarge/reduce
      spell on yourself with this trait, without requiring a material component.
      Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the invisibility spell on
      yourself with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you
      cast either of these spells with this trait, you can't cast that spell
      with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells
      using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.</p><p>Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you
      cast them with this trait (choose when you select this
      species).</p><p><strong>Dwarven Resilience</strong>. You have advantage on
      saving throws you make to avoid or end the poisoned condition on yourself.
      You also have resistance to poison damage.</p><p><strong>Psionic
      Fortitude</strong>. You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid
      or end the charmed or stunned condition on yourself</p>
