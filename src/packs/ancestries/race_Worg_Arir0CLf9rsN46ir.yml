    value: >-
      <p>While sometimes mistaken for large wolves, worgs are a unique species
      of canid predator possessing keen intelligence and the power of speech.
      Worg senses are sharper than those of humans, and they feel a deep
      connection to the natural world; they delight in scents and sounds that
      others around them may not even notice. The worgs of the Watching Wood are
      devoted to the Devourer and the Fury, and this faith encourages them to
      rely on their instincts and intuition, as well as taking joy in the hunt
      and strengthening their pack.</p><p>The worgs of the Watching Wood are
      more compact than some other strains of the species. They are Medium
      creatures, though they can pull heavy loads and carry a Medium creature as
      a rider. While they have no hands and typically have little interest in
      material goods, the smiths of Maenya’s Fist have developed specialized
      armor for worgs, along with Steel Jaws that strengthen a worg’s bite and
      which can be enchanted like any other weapon.</p>
