    value: >-
      <p>You hold one of the highest honors among dragonborn. You are a
      Svern'vyth Arytiss, a Skysteel Warrior, one of the blue dragonborn
      vanguards who aid the Storm Guardians. Your life has been one of
      relentless training and battle, fighting off the servants of the Unmaker
      and the horrid things that climb from Khyber. It's not often that one such
      as yourself leaves their station to go adventuring; either you have been
      exiled, or you have come here with great purpose.</p><p><strong>Creature
      Type</strong>. You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. Your size
      is Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Breath Weapon</strong>. When you take the Attack
      action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an
      exhalation of magical energy in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each
      creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your
      Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the
      creature takes 1d10 lightning damage. On a successful save, it takes half
      as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level
      (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p><p>You can use your
      Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
      regain all expended uses when you finish a long
      rest.</p><p><strong>Blessing of the Storm Guardians.</strong> As a blue
      dragonborn, you have been gifted with the power of lightning, both to
      wield and to protect yourself with. You have resistance to lightning
      damage.</p><p>Starting at 5th level, as an action, you can channel your
      draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you become immune to
      lightning damage. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you
      finish a long rest</p>
