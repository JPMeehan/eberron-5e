      <p>You are a scaled ara’sihei - a ‘child of the sun’. Your people can be
      found across Xen’drik, from the waterways of the Hydra to the glacial
      Thunderwall. Unlike Q’barra, the ‘lizardfolk’ of Xen’drik are not united
      under a single culture by the couatl, and have a variety of different
      forms and beliefs. You might be lithe and camouflaged like the
      Shiftscales, spined and adapted to desert heat like the Nektari, or large
      and feathered like the behemoth dinosaurs of your home. As an ara’sihei,
      the moods and shifting expressions of the scaleless can be hard to
      interpret at first, just as they struggle to interpret your body language
      and shifting colors. Xen’drik has many threats both old and new, and
      ara’sihei adventurers can often be found working in service to their
      people.</p><p>When creating an ara’sihei character,
      consider:</p><ol><li>In lieu of facial expressions, how do you convey your
      mood and emotions?</li><li>You can go for up to a week without eating a
      large meal; when you do, how do you treat your relationship to
      food?</li><li>How do you deal with uncomfortably cold temperatures before
      you have time to warm up</li></ol><p>Lizardfolk have secondary names
      shared between clutchmates, based on the events of their
      hatching.</p><p><strong>Names</strong>: Ghruzh, Aktesh, Ihathu, Sesk,
      Ara’saz, Thrijast, Ukathsi, Aqelka</p><p><strong>Clutch Names</strong>:
      Dark Sky, Sun Tide, Year of Plenty, Grand Hunt, River Song, Sky Fall</p>
