      <p>You are a scaled ara’sihei - a ‘child of the sun’. Your people can be
      found across Xen’drik, from the waterways of the Hydra to the glacial
      Thunderwall. Unlike Q’barra, the ‘lizardfolk’ of Xen’drik are not united
      under a single culture by the couatl, and have a variety of different
      forms and beliefs. You might be lithe and camouflaged like the
      Shiftscales, spined and adapted to desert heat like the Nektari, or large
      and feathered like the behemoth dinosaurs of your home. As an ara’sihei,
      the moods and shifting expressions of the scaleless can be hard to
      interpret at first, just as they struggle to interpret your body language
      and shifting colors. Xen’drik has many threats both old and new, and
      ara’sihei adventurers can often be found working in service to their
      people.</p><p>When creating an ara’sihei character,
      consider:</p><ol><li>In lieu of facial expressions, how do you convey your
      mood and emotions?</li><li>You can go for up to a week without eating a
      large meal; when you do, how do you treat your relationship to
      food?</li><li>How do you deal with uncomfortably cold temperatures before
      you have time to warm up</li></ol><p><strong>Size</strong>: You are
      Small.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Your walking speed is 25 feet, and
      you have a climbing speed equal to your walking
      speed.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Chameleon Scales</strong>. As an action, you can
      change the color of your scales to match the color and texture of your
      surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to
      hide in those surroundings. If you do not move for 1 minute while your
      scales match in this way, you become invisible until you move, attack, or
      cast a spell.</p><p><strong>Natural Armor</strong>. While you aren’t
      wearing armor, your scaly skin gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your
      Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if
      the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC.</p><p><strong>Roving
      Eyes</strong>. Your eyes can move independently, granting you proficiency
      in Perception. Additionally, you cannot be surprised while you are
      conscious</p><p>Lizardfolk have secondary names shared between
      clutchmates, based on the events of their
      hatching.</p><p><strong>Names</strong>: Ghruzh, Aktesh, Ihathu, Sesk,
      Ara’saz, Thrijast, Ukathsi, Aqelka</p><p><strong>Clutch Names</strong>:
      Dark Sky, Sun Tide, Year of Plenty, Grand Hunt, River Song, Sky Fall</p>
