      <p>Your people’s legends mark you as the true children of the Progenitors.
      Kobolds revere the three dragons of the world, divided based on their
      heritage. Eberron’s iredar dwell in high mountain caverns, kept safe from
      threats by traps and their skill at working stone. Beneath the world, the
      irsvhir of Khyber have reclaimed many giant ruins, defending them from
      danger. Others work in tandem with cities such as Stormreach, acting as
      guides and architects. Most mysterious of all, the winged irsvern are
      disciples of Siberys. They are said to live atop the highest mountains,
      where ancient monasteries of divine sages gaze upon the shifting stars.
      Regardless of their culture, kobolds have a knack for innate sorcery and
      interpreting the Prophecy. What has led you to leave the safety of your
      home?</p><p>When creating a Kobold character, consider:</p><ol><li>What
      form does your worship of your progenitor take?</li><li>How do you see the
      dragons, who also claim to be the progenitors’ children?</li><li>How do
      you respond to the many dangers of the world beyond your
      clan?</li></ol><p><strong>Creature Type</strong>. You are a
      Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>. You are
      Small.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong>. Your walking speed is 30
      feet.</p><p><strong>Darkvision</strong>. You can see in dim light within
      60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
      dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of
      gray</p><p><strong>Draconic Cry</strong>. As a bonus action, you let out a
      cry at your enemies within 10 feet of you. Until the start of your next
      turn, you and your allies have advantage on attack rolls against any of
      those enemies who could hear you. You can use this trait a number of times
      equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>Kobold Legacy</strong>. Kobolds’
      connection to dragons can manifest in unpredictable ways in an individual
      kobold. Choose one of the following legacy options for your
      kobold:</p><ul><li><strong>Craftiness</strong>. You have proficiency in
      one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, Investigation,
      Medicine, Sleight of Hand, or Survival.</li><li><strong>Defiance</strong>.
      You have advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the frightened
      condition on yourself.</li><li><strong>Draconic Sorcery</strong>. You know
      one cantrip of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for that cantrip (choose
      when you select this ancestry).</li><li><strong>Iredar
      Druidcraft</strong>. You know one cantrip of your choice from the druid
      spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability
      for that cantrip (choose when you select this
      ancestry).</li><li><strong>Irsvern Wings</strong>. You possess small wings
      granted by your Siberyan heritage, which grant you a 15ft fly speed. At
      5th level, this fly speed becomes equal to your walking
      speed.</li><li><strong>Irvhir Arcana</strong>. You know one cantrip of
      your choice from the warlock spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
      is your spellcasting ability for that cantrip (choose when you select this
      ancestry).</li></ul><p>Kobold names are derived from Draconic, and
      phonetically simplified in comparison.</p><p><strong>Names</strong>:
