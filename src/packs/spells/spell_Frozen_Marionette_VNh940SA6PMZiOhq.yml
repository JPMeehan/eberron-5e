    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to lock a creature within a tomb of ice, puppeteering it
      against its comrades. The target must make a Strength saving throw, taking
      5d8 cold damage and becoming &amp;Reference[restrained] on a failure. On a
      success, the creature takes the damage but is not restrained. A restrained
      creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to
      end the effect. When a creature restrained by this spell is reduced to 0
      hit points, you can use your reaction to puppeteer its frozen form,
      immediately moving it up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice and
      forcing it to make a single melee attack against a creature you can see.
      </p><p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> When you cast this spell using a
      spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each
      spell slot above 3rd.</p>
