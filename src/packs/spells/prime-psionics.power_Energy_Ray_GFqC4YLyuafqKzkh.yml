      <p>You hold your hand aloft and generate a font of pure energy within it.
      When you cast this spell, choose one of the following damage types: cold,
      fire, lightning, or thunder.</p><p>Until your focus ends, you can use your
      action to target one creature within range and shoot a ray of energy at
      it. Make a ranged power attack against the target. On a hit, the target
      takes 1d8 points of damage of the type you chose when you cast this
      spell.</p><p> This power allows you to shoot more than one ray as an
      action when you reach higher levels: two rays at 5th level, three rays at
      11th level, and four rays at 17th level. You can direct the rays at the
      same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each
      ray</p>
