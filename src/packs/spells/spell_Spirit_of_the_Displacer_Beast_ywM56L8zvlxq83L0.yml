    value: >-
      <p>You call forth a nature spirit to ward off attacks through illusion and
      cunning. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 10-foot cube
      you can see within range, appearing as an intangible displacer beast.
      </p><p>Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves
      into the spirit’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn
      there, you can cause the spirit to grant it an illusory copy that masks
      its movements. Whenever a creature with an illusory copy is hit by an
      attack, the attacker must roll a d6. On a result of 4-6, the attack hits
      the copy instead, dispelling it but leaving the true target undamaged and
      unaffected. A creature is unaffected by this spell’s illusory duplicates
      if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as
      blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.
      </p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30
      feet to a space you can see. The spirit can grant illusions a number of
      times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice),
      and disappears after doing so</p>
