      <p>You ask a question of one creature that can see and hear you within
      range, your voice reverberating with unnatural gravitas. The question must
      be phrased so that it can be answered with a yes or no, otherwise the
      power fails. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it
      replies with a truthful answer.</p><p> A creature is immune to this effect
      if it does not share a language with you or if it is immune to being
      charmed</p>
