      "value": "<p>You draw out a fragment of a living soul and bind it within the lantern used as a material component for this spell. Choose a creature you can see within 60 feet of you that isn’t an Undead or Construct. For the duration, the lantern is ignited by the target’s soul and sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. At the start of each of the target’s turns until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 necrotic damage. On a successful save, the target takes no damage, but its soul remains bound. If the target’s saving throw succeeds by 5 or more, its soul becomes unbound and the spell ends.</p><p>Until the spell ends, as a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that isn’t an Undead or Construct. That creature regains hit points equal to the total damage dealt by this spell, up to a maximum of 20 hit points, and the spell ends.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the maximum hit points regained increases by 10 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>",
