      <p>You partially open your third eye, or the third eye of a willing
      creature you touch, granting the target a mystic sense that allows it to
      perceive what would not normally be possible. Until your concentration
      ends, the target can see all creatures, including hidden and invisible
      ones, regardless of lighting
      conditions.</p><p><em><strong>Intensify.</strong></em> If you spend 2
      additional psi points when manifesting this augment beyond its minimum
      cost, you manifest it as a 4th level power, and you open the target
      creature’s third eye even wider, granting them this augment’s normal
      effects and allowing them to see through objects that are up to 1 foot
      thick within 30 feet of them.</p><p>If you spend a total of 4 additional
      psi point when manifesting this augment beyond its minimum cost, you
      manifest it as a 5th level power, opening the creature’s third eye
      completely, granting them this augment’s 3rd and 4th-level effects, plus
      truesight with a range of 30 feet for the duration of the power.</p>
