      <p>You mentally excite the air molecules before you, forming a wall of
      pure sound. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. At
      least one 10-foot-long section of the wall must be within range when you
      form the wall. The wall lasts for the duration. Every foot moved through
      the wall costs 1 extra foot of movement. When a creature moves into the
      wallâ€™s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that
      creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or it takes 6d6 thunder
      damage, is pushed in a straight line up to 30 feet away from the wall, and
      is knocked prone.</p><p> The wall blocks any sound from passing through
      it, and the cacophony it creates can be heard up to 500 feet away. If
      another effect that deals thunder damage overlaps with the wall or crosses
      through it, the wall absorbs the effect, dispelling or destroying it.</p>
