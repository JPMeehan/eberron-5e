      <p>You lead a caravan of two or more willing mystic travelers (creatures
      affected by the
      @UUID[Compendium.eberron-5e.spells.Item.Gkt1NW0CDxiZqEvT]{mystic traveler}
      power manifested by you previously, one of which must be yourself) into
      the Astral Plane and beyond. When you manifest this power, you must
      specify another plane of existence as your destination (and may choose a
      specific location within that plane). Then, all mystic travelers are
      transported to the Astral Plane, where you begin to travel to your
      destination. This power automatically fails if you are already on the
      Astral Plane when you manifest it.</p><p>Your journey through the Astral
      Plane is not instantaneous, instead taking several days, and arrival at
      your destination is not guaranteed. At the end of each day of astral
      travel, you must make a [[/skill arcana 15]] check. Successes bring you
      closer to your destination and failures lead you further away. Your
      journey ends if you accrue either three successes or three failures. The
      DM may grant you disadvantage or advantage on these checks, depending on
      certain factors (the waxing or waning periods of your destination plane,
      your familiarity with your destination, etc.). The result of your journey
      depends on how many failures you accrued before it ends:</p><p>If your
      journey ends with no failures, all mystic travelers are transported to
      your intended plane of existence, within [[/r 1d10]] miles of your
      destination on that plane if you specified one, or arriving at a random
      location on that plane if you did not.</p><p>If your journey ends with
      only 1 failure, all mystic travelers are transported to your intended
      plane of existence, arriving at a random location, but suffer two levels
      of exhaustion due to the difficulties of the astral journey.</p><p>If your
      journey ends with 2 failures, you are forced to turn back, arriving within
      [[/r 1d10]] miles of the location you manifested this power. Additionally,
      all mystic travelers suffer four levels of exhaustion as your astral
      journey was especially tiring and rough.</p><p>If your journey ends
      because you accrued 3 failures, all mystic travelers run afoul of
      turbulent psychic currents of the Astral Plane. Each mystic traveler must
      make a [[/save charisma dc=@attributes.spelldc]] saving throw, taking
      [[/damage 10d6 psychic average]] on a failed save, or half as much on a
      successful one. Then, regardless of the result of the saving throw, each
      mystic traveler suffers two levels of exhaustion and is transported to a
      random plane of existence, separated from its fellow travelers.</p><p>In
      addition to the pure navigational challenge of the journey, the DM may
      describe additional encounters and challenges the mystic travelers might
      face along the way.</p>
