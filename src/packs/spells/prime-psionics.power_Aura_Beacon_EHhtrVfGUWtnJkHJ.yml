      <p>You visibly manifest your aura. While you focus, a bright light
      radiates from your body. When you cast this spell, and as a bonus action
      while you continue to focus on it, you may modulate the radius of the
      aura’s light, from as short as 1 inch, to as long as 20 feet. Regardless
      of the length of this radius of bright light, a radius of dim light of
      equal length extends out from the bright light. Your aura’s light can be
      colored as you like.</p>
