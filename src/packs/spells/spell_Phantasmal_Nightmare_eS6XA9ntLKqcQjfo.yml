    value: >-
      <p>You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and
      create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to
      that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure,
      the target takes 4d10 psychic damage and becomes
      &amp;Reference[frightened] until the end of its next turn, or until you
      stop concentrating. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and
      isn’t frightened.</p><p>At the end of its next turn, a creature that is
      still frightened by this spell must repeat the saving throw. On a failure,
      the creature’s hit points drop to 0. On a success, the creature is
      frightened for the duration of this spell.</p>
