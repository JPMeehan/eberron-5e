    value: >-
      <p>One creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed
      on a Wisdom saving throw or have its head wrapped in a nimbus of glowing
      light. Creatures who do not dream, such as kalashtar and most constructs,
      automatically succeed on the saving throw against this spell. The nimbus
      is a manifestation of the target’s psychic connection to Dal Quor, the
      Region of Dreams, creating sensory input that overlaps the target’s
      perceptions of reality with those of dreamspace. For the duration of the
      spell, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom checks. When
      the spell ends, the target’s memory of the spell’s duration is hazy and
      instinct, easily written off as a vivid daydream. </p><p><em><strong>At
      Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot
      of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
      slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other
      when you target them.</p>
