    value: >-
      <p>You call forth a nature spirit to bestow your allies with the hunter’s
      cunning of Vulkoor. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a
      10-foot cube you can see within range, appearing as a transparent giant
      scorpion.</p><p>Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can
      see moves into the spirit’s space for the first time on a turn or starts
      its turn there, you can cause the spirit to grant them its striking venom.
      The next time the creature hits with a melee attack, the target must make
      a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 poison
      damage and becoming &amp;Reference[poisoned] until the end of its next
      turn on a failure. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage, and
      is not poisoned.</p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the
      spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see. The spirit can grant this
      blessing a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier
      (minimum of twice), and disappears after doing so</p>
