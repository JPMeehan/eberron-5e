    value: >-
      <p>You imbue yourself or one willing creature you touch with the
      duplicitous power of Dol Azur, laying a trap to ensnare a foe in spectral
      bindings. The next time the imbued creature is hit with an attack before
      the spell ends, the attacking creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On
      a failed save, the attacking creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage and is
      restrained until the spell ends. On a successful save, it takes half as
      much damage, is not restrained, and the spell ends. While restrained by
      this spell, the restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
      of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.</p><p><em><strong>At
      Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot
      of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
      above 2nd.</p>
