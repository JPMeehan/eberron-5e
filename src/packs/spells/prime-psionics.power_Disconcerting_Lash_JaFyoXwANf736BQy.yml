      <p>You inject a sudden, unsettling, and alien feeling in the mind of one
      creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving
      throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 psychic damage and canâ€™t move closer
      to you until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half
      as much damage and suffers no other effect. A creature is immune to this
      effect if it is immune to being
      frightened.</p><p><strong>Intensify.</strong> When you spend extra psi
      points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d6 for each
      additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost. </p>
