    value: >-
      <p>You use the material component of this spell as a planar anchor,
      harmonizing yourself and the area surrounding the anchor with a plane of
      your choice. The anchor must be placed anywhere within range, and the
      spell fails if you don’t remain within range of the anchor during the
      entire casting time.</p><p>When you finish casting the spell, the anchor
      melds into the environment, creating a localized weakness in the planar
      boundary that precipitates the creation of a 5-foot-radius manifest zone
      tied to your chosen plane. The fledgling zone expands in radius at the
      rate of 5 feet per day, to a maximum of 150 feet. Additional castings of
      this spell don’t stack, but multiple adjacent or overlapping areas can be
      created.</p><p> The new manifest zone has one planar trait of your choice
      from the plane to which it is tied.</p>
