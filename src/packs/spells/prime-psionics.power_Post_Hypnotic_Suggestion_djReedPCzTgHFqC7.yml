      <p>You mentally implant a suggested course of activity (limited to a
      sentence or two) and a triggering event (such as “when you awake two days
      from now” or “when you come within sixty feet of the local Countess”) to
      magically influence a creature you are telepathically communicating with.
      Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.</p><p>When you
      manifest this power, the target must immediately make a Wisdom saving
      throw. On a success, the target perceives a faint whisper intruding into
      its mind, but is not otherwise affected, and you know the suggestion did
      not take hold. On a failure, the suggestion and trigger are telepathically
      implanted in the target without their notice. The suggestion must be
      worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable.
      Suggesting the creature stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate
      itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.</p><p>Once
      the triggering condition is met, the target pursues the course of action
      you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action
      can continue for up to 8 hours after the triggering condition is met. If
      the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends
      when the subject finishes what it was influenced to do. The target will
      not be able to explain why it took the actions you compelled it to take
      after the suggestion is triggered and it will have no memory of the
      suggestion or trigger being implanted.</p><p>Whenever the target creature
      finishes a long rest, it may repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the
      effect on a success, though it will still not realize it was affected. If
      the triggering condition is not met before the power expires, the
      suggested activity isn’t performed. If you or any of your companions
      damage the target, the power ends.</p>
