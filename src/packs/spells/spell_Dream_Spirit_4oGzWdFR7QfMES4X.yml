    value: >-
      <p>You reach through the faded link to Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams, and
      for the duration of this spell you pull the spirit of a predatory,
      drifting dream creature through to your plane. The dream spirit remains on
      your current plane for the duration of this spell or until you cast this
      spell again and it attacks creatures you direct it to. The dream spirit
      does not occupy a space, and is immune to all damage. </p><p>When you cast
      the spell, make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of
      the dream spirit. On a hit, the target takes psychic damage equal to 2d6 +
      your spellcasting ability modifier. As a bonus action on your turn, you
      can move the dream spirit up to 30 feet and repeat the attack against a
      creature within 5 feet of it. </p><p>The dream spirit attacks by
      telepathically sensing a target’s psychic link to Dal Quor and briefly
      becoming the creature’s worst nightmare, but is only visible as such to
      the target. Otherwise, the dream spirit is visible only as a distinct haze
      in the air. Creatures who do not dream, such as kalashtar and most
      constructs, are immune to the dream spirit’s attacks. </p><p><strong>At
      Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
      level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels
      above 3rd.</p>
