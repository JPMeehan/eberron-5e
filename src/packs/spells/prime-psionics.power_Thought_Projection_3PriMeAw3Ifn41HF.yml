      <p>You create a psychic projection within 60 feet of you, hovering in the
      air. The projection lasts for as long as you concentrate and is invisible.
      It has normal vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet and can look
      in all directions, and you mentally receive visual information from it. As
      an action, you can move the projection up to 30 feet in any direction.
      There is no limit to how far away from you the projection can move, but it
      can’t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the
      projection’s movement, but it can pass through an opening as small as 1
      inch in diameter.</p><p><em><strong>Intensify.</strong></em> If you spend
      1 additional psi point beyond the minimum cost, the projection you create
      can move through solid objects, but can’t end its movement in one. If it
      does so, the power immediately ends.</p>
