  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You call forth a nature spirit to bestow your allies with a bird’s
      speed in flight. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot
      cube you can see within range, appearing as an intangible tilxin
      hummingbird.</p><p>Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you
      can see moves into the spirit’s space for the first time on a turn or
      starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to grant them a tilxin’s
      speed. An affected creature gains an extra action for that turn, which
      they can only use to Dash, Disengage, or Dodge.</p><p>As a bonus action on
      your turn, you can move the spirit up to 80 feet to a space you can see.
      The spirit can grant this blessing a number of times equal to 1 + your
      spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice), and disappears after
      doing so.</p>
