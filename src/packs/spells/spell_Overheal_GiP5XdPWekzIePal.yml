    value: >-
      <p>You channel vast amounts of positive energy into a creature that you
      touch - an amount meant to heal giants, not smaller humanoids. Roll 10d10.
      The creature regains hit points equal to that amount. If the creature is
      healed beyond their hit point maximum, they then take radiant damage equal
      to the excess healing. For example, a rolled result of 40 would heal a
      creature missing 50 hit points for that amount with no side effects. A
      creature missing 30 hit points would instead be healed to full, then take
      10 radiant damage.</p><p>An unwilling creature can attempt a [[/save con
      dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] saving throw to resist the effect. Creatures
      other than Undead have advantage. On a success, they are unaffected by the
      spell.</p>
