      <p>Your force of will overwhelms another creature, allowing you to control
      its higher motor functions. You target one creature you are telepathically
      communicating with. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a
      failed save, while you concentrate, you choose the target’s movement on
      each of its turns and all of its actions and reactions. On a successful
      save, the target is unaffected. At the end of each of the target’s turns
      it can repeat the saving throw, ending the power on a success.</p><p> A
      creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to being charmed.</p>
