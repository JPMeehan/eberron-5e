      <p>When you manifest this augment, and as your action on each turn until
      your concentration ends, you can focus your mind on one creature you are
      telepathically communicating with.</p><p>When you initially begin to focus
      on a creature, you initially learn its surface thoughtsâ€”what is most on
      its mind in that moment. As an action, you can attempt to probe deeper
      into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a
      Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if
      any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind
      (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, this
      power ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its
      mind.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally
      shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective
      as part of an interrogation.</p>
