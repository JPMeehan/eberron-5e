      <p>You store your potential energy and release it as a burst of
      psychoportation. If you have not yet moved on your turn, you may manifest
      this augment to teleport up to 20 feet, and then your speed is reduced to
      0 until the beginning of your next turn. If you manifest this augment
      after you have moved on your turn, it fails.
      </p><p><em><strong>Intensify.</strong></em> When you spend extra psi
      points to manifest this augment, the maximum distance you can teleport is
      increased by 20 feet for each additional psi point spent beyond the
      minimum cost.</p>
