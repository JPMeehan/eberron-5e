  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You tie together your own momentum and velocity with those of a
      creature that you can see within range. Until the end of your turn,
      whenever you move, the creature moves the same distance and direction as
      you. It cannot be made to move further than its own speed, and does not
      provoke opportunity attacks while moving in this way. A creature with
      multiple types of movement can choose which of its movement speeds to
      use.</p><p>An unwilling creature can attempt a Wisdom saving throw to
      resist the effect.</p>
