      <p>You form your thoughts into a briefly perceptible whip of telepathic
      energy, and strike the mind of one creature you can see within range,
      forcefully imposing a sudden and intense feeling of self-doubt in it. The
      target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
      takes 3d8 psychic damage, and it can only take the Dodge, Disengage, or
      Hide actions on its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the target
      takes half as much damage, and its choice of action is not limited by this
      power.</p><p><em><strong>Intensify.</strong></em> When you spend extra psi
      points to manifest this augment, you may target 1 additional creature you
      can see within range for every 2 additional psi points spent beyond the
      minimum cost.</p>
