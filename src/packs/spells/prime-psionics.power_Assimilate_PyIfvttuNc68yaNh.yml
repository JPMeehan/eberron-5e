      <p>You touch a creature and assimilate their life force and matter into
      your body. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
      save, the target takes 7d6 + 20 force damage and you gain temporary hit
      points equal to half the damage dealt. If this damage reduces the target
      to 0 hit points, the target is completely assimilated.</p><p>A completely
      assimilated creature dies and its entire body, including everything it is
      wearing and carrying, except magic items, is broken down and absorbed
      entirely into your body. The creature can be restored to life only by
      means of true resurrection, reality revision, or similar magic.</p><p>When
      you completely assimilate a creature, your hit point maximum increases by
      2 for every hit die the target creature possessed. Additionally, you gain
      a semblance of the creatureâ€™s form, granting you advantage on ability
      checks to impersonate it. Both of these effects last until you finish a
      long rest.</p><p>This power has no effect on undead or
      constructs.</p><p><strong>Intensify.</strong> When you spend extra psi
      points to manifest this augment, the damage increases by 1d6 for each
      additional psi point spent beyond the minimum cost. <br /></p>
