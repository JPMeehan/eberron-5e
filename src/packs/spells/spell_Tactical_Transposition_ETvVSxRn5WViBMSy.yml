    value: >-
      <p>You tactically rearrange the positions of creatures within a 40-foot
      cube within range. Every creature of your choice within that area is
      teleported by you, in an order of your choosing, to any other unoccupied
      location on the ground or floor within the area. An unwilling creature can
      attempt a Charisma saving throw to avoid being teleported in this
      way.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the size of the affected area
      increases by 10 feet for every level above 4th</p>
