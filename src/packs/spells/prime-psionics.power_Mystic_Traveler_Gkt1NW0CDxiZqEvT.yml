      <p>You or one willing creature you touch become a mystic traveler, able to
      join a group journey enabled by the
      @UUID[Compendium.eberron-5e.spells.Item.kP7HCc2ClFR8CtJ4]{mystic caravan}
      power. This powerâ€™s duration ends early if the mystic traveler is not
      affected by you manifesting mystic caravan within 1 hour of manifesting
      this power. This power also ends early if the mystic caravan journey
      ends.</p><p>For the duration of a mystic caravan journey, mystic travelers
      must remain within 15 feet of at least one other mystic traveler. If a
      mystic traveler is out of this formation for more than 1 round, the mystic
      traveler power is automatically dispelled on that creature, and it is sent
      tumbling through the rough psychic currents of the Astral Plane. Such
      creatures must make a [[/save charisma dc=@attributes.spelldc]] saving
      throw, taking [[/damage 10d6 psychic]] damage on a failure, or half as
      much on a success, and are then transported to a random plane of
      existence.</p>
