    value: >-
      <p>A great wave of salt water bursts from the ground beneath your feet.
      Each creature in a 30-foot cube originating from you must make a Strength
      saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage
      and is pushed 15 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature
      takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.</p><p>Along with the wave, you
      conjure the spirit of a great shark. Choose one creature that failed its
      saving throw as the shark spirit’s prey. That target takes an extra 2d10
      piercing damage and is restrained by the shark spirit’s jaws. A target
      restrained in this way can use its action to make a Strength check against
      your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself and the shark spirit
      disappears.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage of
      the wave and the damage of the spirit shark’s jaws each increase by 1d10
      for each slot level above 4th.</p>
