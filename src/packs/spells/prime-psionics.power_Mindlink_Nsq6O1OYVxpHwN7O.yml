      <p>You contact the mind of another creature you can see within range,
      granting you the ability to communicate with it telepathically while you
      focus on this power. While you focus, the target can telepathically
      communicate with you as well. If you don’t share a language with the
      target, you can convey emotions and feelings, but can’t engage in complex
      conversation. The target must have an Intelligence of at least 4,
      otherwise this spell fails and the casting time is wasted. You can only
      communicate with the target while it remains in range.</p><p> Until your
      focus ends, you can use a bonus action to switch the target of this spell
      to another creature you can see within range. The spell ends if the new
      target does not have an Intelligence of at least 4</p>
