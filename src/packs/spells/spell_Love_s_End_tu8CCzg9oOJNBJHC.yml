    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, if you are not a fiend you take 2d12 psychic
      damage that cannot be mitigated in any way.</p><p>You blast a
      greenish-black ray of evil energy at a creature you can see within range.
      On a hit, the target takes no damage. Instead, the target’s dearest loved
      one (such as a mate, spouse, best friend, or family member) takes 1d10
      psychic damage, regardless of the distance between the caster, target, and
      loved one. If the target’s loved one is in an antimagic field, this spell
      has no effect. On the rare occurrence that the target creature has no
      loved one, it takes the damage instead.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a slot of 3rd level or
      higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above
      2nd.</p>
