      <p>When you cast this spell, if you are not a fiend you take [[/damage
      2d12 psychic]] damage that cannot be mitigated in any way.</p><p>You blast
      a greenish-black ray of evil energy at a creature you can see within
      range. On a hit, the target takes no damage. Instead, the target’s dearest
      loved one (such as a mate, spouse, best friend, or family member) takes
      1d10 psychic damage, regardless of the distance between the caster,
      target, and loved one. If the target’s loved one is in an antimagic field,
      this spell has no effect. On the rare occurrence that the target creature
      has no loved one, it takes the damage instead.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a slot of 3rd level or
      higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above
      2nd.</p>
