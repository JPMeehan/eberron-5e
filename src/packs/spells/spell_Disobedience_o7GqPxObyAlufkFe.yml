    value: >-
      <p>You shield your subject against mind-controlling spells and abilities.
      Disobedience blocks any attempt to exercise mental control over the
      subject creature, including charms that grant ongoing control over the
      subject, such as dominate person or a vampire's dominate ability. The
      protection does not prevent such effects from targeting a subject affected
      by disobedience, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of this
      spell. If disobedience ends before the effect granting mental control
      does, the would-be controller becomes able to mentally command the
      targeted creature. </p><p>In addition to protecting the subject,
      disobedience sends false information to the creature that is attempting to
      gain control of the subject. The would-be controller must succeed on a
      Wisdom save or believe that its spell or ability has taken effect and that
      the target is now under its control. The spell's subject becomes aware of
      commands issued by that creature and can choose to act however she
      pleases, disregarding the would-be controller's orders or going along with
      them in a pretense of obedience.</p>
