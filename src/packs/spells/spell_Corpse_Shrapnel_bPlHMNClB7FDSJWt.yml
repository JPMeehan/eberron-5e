    value: >-
      <p>As a reaction to a creature that you can see dying, you cause its
      corpse to explode loudly, the bones shattering in a hail of vicious
      shards. Every creature in a 15ft cone in a direction of your choice
      originating from the creatureâ€™s corpse must succeed on a Dexterity saving
      throw or take 2d12 piercing damage. Creatures behind full cover are
      unaffected. The corpse itself is destroyed without a trace. Corpses
      without bones, such as the remains of oozes, are unaffected by this
      spell.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12
      for each spell slot above 1st.</p>
