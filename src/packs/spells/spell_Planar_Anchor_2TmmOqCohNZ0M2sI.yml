    value: >-
      <p>You exploit a weakness in reality and tear open a new wild zone to one
      of Eberron's planes at a point on the Prime Material you can see within
      range. While this zone is open, creatures native to that plane can enter
      and exit it from the rest of the plane, but cannot cross over its
      boundaries to the rest of Eberron. They are also treated as if they're on
      their home plane for effects like banishment. Conversely, a Prime Material
      native is considered to be on a different plane while in the zone, and
      banishment teleports them to a point outside the zone if concentrated on
      for the full duration.</p><p>The zone starts as a 10-foot-radius sphere,
      but every time you cast this spell to the same plane and at the same
      point, its radius increases by another 5 feet, to a maximum of 100 feet.
      If you cast this spell while in a pre-existing wild zone to a different
      plane, it fails. Casting this spell in the same place every day for a week
      increases its duration to 1 year.</p><p> Depending on which plane you
      choose, all creatures in the zone are subject to an additional effect, as
      shown on the following table. The DM can, at their discretion, add in
      other non-mechanical effects the zone might have, or adjust them based on
      a specific planar layer.</p>
