    value: >-
      <p>You call a group of people to a heightened emotional state, driving
      them to anger and mistrust. Each Humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere
      centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving
      throw. On a failed save, a creature must use its reaction (if available)
      to make an opportunity attack whenever another creature (including an
      ally) moves out of its reach. A creature can repeat the saving throw at
      the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The <em>calm
      emotions</em> spell suppresses the effects of this spell.</p>
