  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You turn your gaze on one creature you can see within range. If the
      target can see your eyes, their body stiffens and cracks as if it were
      turning to stone. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw
      or take Necrotic damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus and have
      Disadvantage on the next Dexterity saving throw it makes before the end of
      its next turn.</p>
