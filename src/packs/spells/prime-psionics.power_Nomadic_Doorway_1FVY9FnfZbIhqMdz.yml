      <p>You fold the fabric of reality and bore a doorway between two points in
      space. You create a 5-foot cube of dim, gray light within 5 feet of you,
      and an identical cube at any point of your choice within 1 mile that you
      have viewed within the past 24 hours. The cubes last for the duration. A
      creature entering one of the cubes immediately teleports to the other one,
      appearing in an unoccupied space next to it. The teleportation fails if
      there is no space for the creature to appear
      in.</p><p><em><strong>Intensify.</strong></em> When you spend extra psi
      points to manifest this augment, the maximum distance you can teleport is
      increased by 1 mile for each additional psi point spent beyond the minimum
      cost.</p>
