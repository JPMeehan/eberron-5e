  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You whip up dust and sand into a flowing serpent that lunges at foes.
      Choose 4 contiguous 5ft spaces on the ground in any configuration within
      range. When a creature willingly enters an affected space on its turn for
      the first time, or starts its turn within an affected space, it must
      succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage and be
      blinded until the end of its turn. As a bonus action on following turns,
      you can change the affected spaces to a new set of contiguous spaces
      beginning adjacent to a currently affected space.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels:</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level
      or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every level above 2nd.</p>
