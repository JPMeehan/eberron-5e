      <p>You mirror a creature with its shadowy reflection. If the creature cast
      a spell that is at least 2 levels lower than the level of this spell, you
      also cast that spell as part of your reaction, without expending an
      additional spell slot for that spell.</p><p>The spell you cast uses your
      own spellcasting ability, and if the spell deals damage, it deals psychic
      damage instead of its usual damage types.</p><p>As part of your reaction
      when you cast this spell, you learn what level the target spell is. If the
      level of the spell slot you expended is too low to copy that spell, you
      regain the spell slot you expended. When this happens, you can choose to
      either expend a higher-level spell slot to copy the spell, or choose to
      abort this spell. In either case, your reaction is spent. For example, if
      the other creature casts a 5th-level spell, you can regain your 3rd-level
      spell slot and instead expend a 7th-level spell slot to copy that
      spell.</p>
