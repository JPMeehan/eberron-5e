    value: >-
      <p>You take on a burning guise of terrible beauty, and those who see you
      fear and love you in equal measure. For the spellâ€™s duration, every
      creature of your choice that starts its turn within 15 feet and can see
      you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become charmed by you.
      Creatures immune to being charmed are unaffected. While charmed in this
      way, a creature must use its movement each turn to move as close to you as
      directly possible. An affected creature can choose to repeat the saving
      throw at the start of each of its turns to end the effect, becoming immune
      to the spell for 24 hours on a success, but a creature who does so
      successfully takes 2d6 fire and 2d6 psychic damage. A creature can also
      attempt this saving throw if compelled to move into an obvious danger,
      such as a fire, trap, or fall. </p><p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong>
      When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the
      fire damage increases by 1d6 and the radius of the spell increases by 5
      feet for each level above 3rd.</p>
