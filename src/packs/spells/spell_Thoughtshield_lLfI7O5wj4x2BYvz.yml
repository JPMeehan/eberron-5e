    value: >-
      <p>You create an incorporeal dome of shimmering force in a 10 foot radius
      around yourself, weaving together your allies’ thoughts and preventing
      your enemies from eavesdropping on them. The dome created by this spell
      moves with you. </p><p>All creatures inside the dome gain resistance to
      psychic damage for the spell’s duration, and can telepathically
      communicate with other creatures inside it, so long as both remain within
      range. However, they cannot receive or send telepathic messages to
      creatures outside the dome, even if they are initiated from outside.
      </p><p>All attempts to detect the thoughts or motives of creatures in the
      dome automatically fail, as do abilities that make creatures unable to
      lie, such as zone of truth.</p>
