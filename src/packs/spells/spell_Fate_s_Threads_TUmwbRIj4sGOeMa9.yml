    value: >-
      <p>You conjure the illusion of an immense spider formed of shadow over a
      15-foot radius area within range. Every creature of your choice within the
      area when it appears must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or believe
      themselves tangled in strands of illusory webbing, becoming
      &amp;Reference[restrained]. Creatures immune to being charmed are
      unaffected. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns to end the effect, taking 1d10 piercing damage on a failure as
      they witness the spider striking them with its claws. The effect also ends
      if a restrained creature leaves the area of the spell.</p><p>When a
      creature is reduced to 0 hit points while restrained in this way, you can
      choose to sacrifice them to the Spinner of Shadows, causing their form to
      be pulled upwards and swallowed by the illusion. If you do so, you gain
      advantage on your next attack roll or ability check - and their body will
      never be seen again.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels:</strong> When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage
      increases by 1d10 for each spell slot above 3rd.</p>
