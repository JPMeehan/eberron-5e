    value: >-
      <p>When you cast this spell, if you are not a fiend you take 1 point of
      psychic damage that cannot be mitigated in any way.</p><p>At one point
      during the duration of this spell, you can alter the probability of a
      game, cheating the odds in your favor. You may reroll any ability check or
      die roll used to determine the results of the game, taking the better
      result.</p><p>This spell can only affect nonmagical games, such as those
      using mundane cards or dice. It cannot affect a game involving magic, such
      as an archfeyâ€™s magically enforced wager, nor a magic item involved in a
      game, such as a deck of many things.</p>
