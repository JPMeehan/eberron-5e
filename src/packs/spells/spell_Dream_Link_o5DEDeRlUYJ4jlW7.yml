    value: >-
      <p>You cause yourself and all willing creatures within a 10-foot radius
      centered on you to enter the dreams of a target creature already dreaming
      within that radius. The target creature must make a Wisdom saving throw; a
      willing creature can voluntarily fail. On a failed saving throw, you and
      the other willing creatures fall asleep and telepathically enter the
      target’s dream. This sleep counts towards any sleep necessary for
      completing a long rest. Affected creatures remain asleep until they finish
      a long rest, take any damage outside of the dream, or someone outside of
      the dream uses an action to shake or slap the dreaming creature awake. If
      the target creature wakes up, the effects of the spell immediately end,
      causing all creatures affected by this spell to also wake up.</p><p>While
      within the dream, the rules of reality and the state of the creatures
      affected by this spell are determined by the context of the dream itself.
      If the dream belongs to a player character, they can choose its contents
      and shape ‘reality’ as they wish (within the confines of what their
      character knows). Typically, characters dream of themselves in peak
      performance, with all hit points and resources as though ‘waking up’ from
      a long rest. This state does not carry over to reality if their actual
      long rest is interrupted. A character that “dies” in a dream immediately
      wakes up. A character that wakes this way takes 3d6 psychic damage, gains
      no benefit from their rest, and becomes unable to sleep for the next 24
      hours.</p><p>If the target creature is the target of the dream spell while
      it is also the target of this spell, the messenger sent by the dream spell
      has less control over the shared dream entered by creatures affected by
      this spell than would otherwise be the case as described in the dream
      spell. The messenger can interact with creatures affected by this spell as
      if the messenger were physically present in the dream, using its normal
      statistics, unless the caster of the dream spell sent a monstrous or
      terrifying messenger. In that case, after the monstrous messenger delivers
      its short message, instead of the target of the dream spell making a
      Wisdom saving throw, the DM can decide to resolve the effect of the
      monstrous messenger’s presence with a combat encounter against the
      messenger inside the target’s dream. The monstrous messenger can take any
      form the caster of the dream spell desires, but its statistics have a
      challenge rating equal to no greater than twice the dream spell’s level.
      Defeating the messenger has the same result as succeeding on the saving
      throw against the dream spell, and any creature that “dies” to the
      messenger in the dream suffers the effects described
      above.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast
      this spell while already within a dream using a spell slot of 4th level or
      higher, all creatures affected by the original casting of the spell,
      including the target dreamer, are pulled into a different dream
      representing a deeper layer of the target dreamer’s unconscious. This can
      be repeated, with the required spell slot increasing by two levels for
      every successive layer of dream. A character who ‘dies’ in a deeper level
      of dream wakes up again in the ‘shallower’ level in which this spell was
      cast, and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain a level of
      exhaustion</p>
