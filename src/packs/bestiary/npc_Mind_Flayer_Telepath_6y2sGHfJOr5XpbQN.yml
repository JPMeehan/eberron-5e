    biography:
      value: >-
        <p>Mind flayers are not native to the planet of Eberron. Khorvairian
        sages believe they hail from Xoriat, the Realm of Madness, like their
        daelkyr masters, but few know that their true origins lie even further
        back on the gith homeworld.</p><p><strong>Aberrant Resistances.</strong>
        In the Eberron campaign setting, several kinds of aberrant creatures,
        mind flayers foremost among them, have resistance to damage dealt by
        nearly all kinds of weapons, even magical ones. The only known substance
        that these aberrations are susceptible to is an incredibly dense and
        heavy purple metal found only in the mountain ranges of western
        Khorvaire, known as byeshk. This resistance increases the challenge
        rating of mind flayers and other aberrations in Eberron campaigns, as
        noted in their stat blocks</p><hr /><p>When the Gatekeepers sealed the
        dimensional gates, some mind flayers in Eberron were cut off from the
        elder brains controlling them from Xoriat. These orphaned mind flayers
        became independently sentient, something elder brains find abhorrent,
        like a hand that acts on its own, refusing to listen to the mind. The
        elder brains imprisoned in Khyber attempt to hunt these orphans and
        integrate them into their own hiveminds. Some orphaned mind flayers
        welcome this, while others prefer to make use of their own independence
        and their ability to execute their own inscrutable
        plans.</p><p><strong>Psionic Mind Flayer.</strong> Psionic mind flayers
        do not possess the Innate Spellcasting (Psionics) trait of standard mind
        flayers. Instead, they have the Innate Psionic Powers trait.</p><hr
        /><p>While all mind flayers have psionically potent minds, some
        discipline themselves and study to further their psychic potential. Most
        often, these illithid psions focus on the psionic discipline of
        domination, as befits their natural telepathic abilities.</p>

          automatically dispelled on that creature, and it is sent tumbling
          through the rough psychic currents of the Astral Plane. Such creatures
          must make a [[/save charisma dc=@attributes.spelldc]] saving throw,
          taking [[/damage 10d6 psychic]] damage on a failure, or half as much

          <p>When you manifest this augment, and as your action on each turn

          begin to focus on a creature, you initially learn its surface
          thoughts—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you
          can attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you
          probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails,
          you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and
          something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries
          over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, this power ends. Either way,
          the target knows that you are probing into its mind.</p><p>Questions
          verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of
          its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an
          interrogation.</p>

          (and may choose a specific location within that plane). Then, all
          mystic travelers are transported to the Astral Plane, where you begin
          to travel to your destination. This power automatically fails if you
          are already on the Astral Plane when you manifest it.</p><p>Your
          journey through the Astral Plane is not instantaneous, instead taking
          several days, and arrival at your destination is not guaranteed. At
          the end of each day of astral travel, you must make a [[/skill arcana
          15]] check. Successes bring you closer to your destination and
          failures lead you further away. Your journey ends if you accrue either
          three successes or three failures. The DM may grant you disadvantage
          or advantage on these checks, depending on certain factors (the waxing
          or waning periods of your destination plane, your familiarity with
          your destination, etc.). The result of your journey depends on how
          many failures you accrued before it ends:</p><p>If your journey ends
          with no failures, all mystic travelers are transported to your
          intended plane of existence, within [[/r 1d10]] miles of your
          destination on that plane if you specified one, or arriving at a
          random location on that plane if you did not.</p><p>If your journey
          ends with only 1 failure, all mystic travelers are transported to your
          intended plane of existence, arriving at a random location, but suffer
          two levels of exhaustion due to the difficulties of the astral
          journey.</p><p>If your journey ends with 2 failures, you are forced to
          turn back, arriving within [[/r 1d10]] miles of the location you
          manifested this power. Additionally, all mystic travelers suffer four
          levels of exhaustion as your astral journey was especially tiring and
          rough.</p><p>If your journey ends because you accrued 3 failures, all
          mystic travelers run afoul of turbulent psychic currents of the Astral
          Plane. Each mystic traveler must make a [[/save charisma
          dc=@attributes.spelldc]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 10d6 psychic
          average]] on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Then,
          regardless of the result of the saving throw, each mystic traveler
          suffers two levels of exhaustion and is transported to a random plane
          of existence, separated from its fellow travelers.</p><p>In addition
          to the pure navigational challenge of the journey, the DM may describe
          additional encounters and challenges the mystic travelers might face
          along the way.</p>

          <p>You visibly manifest your aura. While you focus, a bright light
          radiates from your body. When you cast this spell, and as a bonus
          action while you continue to focus on it, you may modulate the radius
          of the aura’s light, from as short as 1 inch, to as long as 20 feet.
          Regardless of the length of this radius of bright light, a radius of
          dim light of equal length extends out from the bright light. Your
          aura’s light can be colored as you like.</p>

          <p>While you focus on this power, you can use your action to target
          one creature you can see within range, making your eyes flare
          noticeably for an instant. The target must succeed on a Charisma
          saving throw or take 1d10 points of psychic damage.</p><p> This
          cantrip’s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10),
          11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p>

          <p>You contact the mind of another creature you can see within range,
          granting you the ability to communicate with it telepathically while
          you focus on this power. While you focus, the target can
          telepathically communicate with you as well. If you don’t share a
          language with the target, you can convey emotions and feelings, but
          can’t engage in complex conversation. The target must have an
          Intelligence of at least 4, otherwise this spell fails and the casting
          time is wasted. You can only communicate with the target while it
          remains in range.</p><p> Until your focus ends, you can use a bonus
          action to switch the target of this spell to another creature you can
          see within range. The spell ends if the new target does not have an
          Intelligence of at least 4</p>

          is reduced to 0 until the beginning of your next turn. If you manifest

          moved through the wall costs 1 extra foot of movement. When a creature
          moves into the wall’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its
          turn there, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or
          it takes 6d6 thunder damage, is pushed in a straight line up to 30
          feet away from the wall, and is knocked prone.</p><p> The wall blocks
          any sound from passing through it, and the cacophony it creates can be
          heard up to 500 feet away. If another effect that deals thunder damage
          overlaps with the wall or crosses through it, the wall absorbs the

          communicating with. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this
          effect.</p><p>When you manifest this power, the target must
          immediately make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the target
          perceives a faint whisper intruding into its mind, but is not
          otherwise affected, and you know the suggestion did not take hold. On
          a failure, the suggestion and trigger are telepathically implanted in
          the target without their notice. The suggestion must be worded in such
          a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Suggesting
          the creature stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself,
          or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.</p><p>Once the
          triggering condition is met, the target pursues the course of action
          you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of
          action can continue for up to 8 hours after the triggering condition
          is met. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time,
          the power ends when the subject finishes what it was influenced to do.
          The target will not be able to explain why it took the actions you
          compelled it to take after the suggestion is triggered and it will
          have no memory of the suggestion or trigger being
          implanted.</p><p>Whenever the target creature finishes a long rest, it
          may repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success,
          though it will still not realize it was affected. If the triggering
          condition is not met before the power expires, the suggested activity
          isn’t performed. If you or any of your companions damage the target,
          the power ends.</p>

          the projection can move, but it can’t enter another plane of
          existence. A solid barrier blocks the projection’s movement, but it
          can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in
          diameter.</p><p><em><strong>Intensify.</strong></em> If you spend 1
          additional psi point beyond the minimum cost, the projection you
          create can move through solid objects, but can’t end its movement in
          one. If it does so, the power immediately ends.</p>

          <p>You fold the fabric of reality and bore a doorway between two
          points in space. You create a 5-foot cube of dim, gray light within 5
          feet of you, and an identical cube at any point of your choice within
          1 mile that you have viewed within the past 24 hours. The cubes last
          for the duration. A creature entering one of the cubes immediately
          teleports to the other one, appearing in an unoccupied space next to
          it. The teleportation fails if there is no space for the creature to
          appear in.</p><p><em><strong>Intensify.</strong></em> When you spend
          extra psi points to manifest this augment, the maximum distance you
          can teleport is increased by 1 mile for each additional psi point
          spent beyond the minimum cost.</p>
