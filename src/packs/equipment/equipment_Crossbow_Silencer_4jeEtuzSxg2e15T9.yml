      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Common</em></p><p>This small magical band can be
      clamped to or removed from the stirrup of any crossbow as an action. While
      the silencer is attached to a weapon, Wisdom (Perception) checks to hear
      the weapon firing are made at disadvantage.</p><p>In addition, if you are
      hidden when you make an attack roll using the silencer’s attached weapon,
      you can activate the silencer (no action required) to remain hidden, and
      your attack doesn't give away your location. Once this property is used,
      it can’t be used again for 10 minutes.</p>
