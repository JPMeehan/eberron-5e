      <p>A common psionic armament found among the ranks of Riedra’s Harmonious
      Shield is the sentira lens, a handheld ranged weapon that can focus a
      wielder’s psionic potential to fire a harmful bolt of telepathic
      energy.</p><p>Unlike a wand or other arcane implement, a sentira lens
      requires very little training to use effectively; even a person with no
      other psionic ability can activate this weapon. The Harmonious Shield
      considers this an important benefit, allowing their loyal soldiers to
      access psionic power while eliminating the usual dangers of cultivating
      innate psychic power in an individual. Since their development in Riedra,
      sentira lenses have gradually found their way into the hands of Adaran
      kalashtar, who are busily trying to replicate the metacreative powers
      necessary to recreate them.</p><h5>Weapon Property: Psiactive</h5><p>A
      psiactive ranged weapon draws its power from your innate psionic
      potential, whether or not you're trained to use it. When attacking with a
      psiactive weapon, you use your choice of your Intelligence or Charisma
      modifier for the attack and damage rolls.</p><p>You can fire psiactive
      weapons a number of times equal to twice your proficiency bonus. After
      that, your psionic potential is temporarily expended and you can’t fire
      another psiactive weapon until you regain your psionic focus by using an
      action or a bonus action (your choice). Your psionic focus is shared
      between all psiactive weapons; whenever you make an attack with any
      psiactive weapon, you expend one of your uses.</p><p>As psiactive weapons
      channel your own latent energy, they aren’t considered magic weapons and
      they can’t be sensed with the detect magic spell or similar magic.
      However, they don’t function in an antimagic field.</p>
