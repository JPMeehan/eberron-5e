      <p>This ancient, heavy marble torc is strangely warm to the touch. Though
      it resembles stone jewelry, the torc is in fact a simple symbiont which
      grants a limited form of control over earth and the ability to manipulate
      quickstone without the usual rituals. To attune to it, you must wear it
      around your neck for the full Attunement period, during which time it
      coils around your throat like a snake.</p><p>While wearing the torc, you
      can use a Magic action to transform a 5-foot cube of quickstone between
      its soft and wet forms, or irreversibly change it into its fixed
      form.</p><p><strong>Spells.</strong> As an Action, you can use the
      symbiote to cast Mold Earth or Meld into Stone. Once you use the torc to
      cast Meld into Stone, the spell can't be cast in this way until the next
      dusk.</p><p><strong>Symbiotic Nature.</strong> The torc can't be removed
      from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your
      Attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your
      Attunement to the torc ends, and it uncoils from around your neck.</p>
