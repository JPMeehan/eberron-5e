      <p>During the Last War, the crossbow was the common infantry weapon in
      many of the Five Nations. While bayonets aren’t as effective as a
      stand-alone melee weapon, they provide crossbow-wielders with an attack
      they can use in close quarters without dropping their crossbow.</p><p>The
      Bayonets table presents two new weapons, which are available from most
      weapons vendors in the Five Nations. The light bayonet is a simple weapon
      that can be attached to a light crossbow, while the heavy bayonet is a
      martial weapon that can be attached to a heavy crossbow. Each bayonet uses
      the following special rule:</p><p><em><strong>Using
      Bayonets.</strong></em> You have disadvantage on attacks made with a
      bayonet that isn’t attached to a crossbow. It takes an action to attach or
      remove a bayonet from a weapon</p>
