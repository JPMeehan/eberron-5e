      <p><em>Ammunition, Common (Cantrip–1st Level) or Uncommon (2nd–3rd
      Level)</em></p><p>A spellbolt is a crossbow bolt imbued with a single
      spell of 3rd level or lower from the wizard spell list, which is activated
      by corresponding arcane sigils engraved into most modern Cannith-issued
      crossbows. The imbued spell must require a ranged or melee spell attack
      when the spell is cast, and have a range other than self.</p><p>As an
      action, you can load the spellbolt into a Cannith-made crossbow and cast
      the spell imbued in the bolt, using the crossbow in place of the spell’s
      components. When you do, the range of the spell is equal to the crossbow’s
      range instead of the spell’s usual range. In place of each spell attack,
      make a ranged weapon attack using the crossbow against a target within
      range; on a hit, apply the spell effects in place of weapon damage. If the
      spell requires a saving throw in addition to the spell attack, its save DC
      is 13. Once the imbued spell is cast, the spellbolt is destroyed and turns
      to dust.</p>
