      <p>Gatekeepers originated the practice of mining byeshk ore and refining
      it into weapons, though the lustrous purple metal is typically only used
      for jewelry outside druidic sects. </p><p>Whenever an aberration is hit
      with a byeshk weapon, it can’t regain hit points until the start of the
      attacker’s next turn. Additionally, certain creatures have a distinct
      aversion to the metal and are resistant or immune to weapons that aren't
      byeshk. </p><p>The byeshk version of a melee weapon or ten pieces of
      ammunition costs 200 gp more than the normal versions.</p>
